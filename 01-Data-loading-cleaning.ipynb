       "article       (CNN) -- Dan Wallrath was honored as a Top 10 CNN Hero last year for his efforts to build mortgage-free homes for U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. He and his group, Operation Finally Home, recently partnered with the television show \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" to build a house for Army Staff Sgt. Patrick Zeigler, who survived the 2009 shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas. CNN Heroes producer Kathleen Toner recently spoke to Wallrath about the experience, which will air on ABC on Sunday night. Kathleen Toner: How was working with \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" different from one of your typical builds? Dan Wallrath: The biggest difference was just the magnitude of it. The first day when we had the Braveheart March, where volunteers and builders march in, that was very exciting -- getting things kicked off, just feeling the energy of all the volunteers and the folks. Video: Watch volunteers arrive at the build site . And then this house was built in about 100 hours, where normally we take about six months. When you do it in a week, you see the impact of the whole community. We had so many volunteers. It was amazing how smooth everything went. Of course on our other projects, we get to interact with the family a lot more during the construction. So we missed that. But the good part about working with the show is that the family has this amazing week where everything changes. So it's pretty exciting. Toner: Building a house in 100 hours sounds almost impossible. How did it really work? Wallrath: There were probably 4,000 or 5,000 volunteers involved, and it was a 24-hour work site. They set up floodlights and worked 'round the clock. They had to talk to the neighbors and let them know it's going to be going on 24/7, but the community was all for it. What amazed me was that meant that people were volunteering at all hours. To volunteer from midnight until 4, 5 o'clock in the morning -- when the cameras and the celebrities are not there -- that's pretty special. I'd built homes for 30 years and never seen anything like that. And we stayed ahead of schedule. I was impressed. They said that if we didn't exceed the record (for their shortest build time), we came real close. Toner: What was the moment like when the family saw the home for the first time? Did you really say the show's signature line? Wallrath: (laughs) We really did say, \"Move that bus!\" It was special. There were so many people there that day who'd helped out. It was very exciting to see the look on the faces of the young couple. It's the same look I've seen so many times when we've given away homes before -- when the young man realizes that no matter what happens to them, his family is going to be taken care of. For him, going through everything he has, to see that burden being lifted off him, it was such a joy. Toner: I hear you have plans for the empty lot next door to that home? Wallrath: We had such a good response from the community (Salado, Texas, about 30 minutes from Fort Hood), so we felt like it was the right place to put another family. We spoke to the developer that we worked with, and he gave us that lot at a very discounted price. And we've found a great couple that's going to be in this house: another wounded veteran. It'll just be great for them to have another veteran nearby. You and I can't relate to what they went through, but all of the guys tell me that when they have tough times, there's no substitute for talking to someone who's been through the same thing. Toner: And you've established a fund where people can donate to help others wounded in the Fort Hood attack. Wallrath: We're going to reach out to the other families that are all over the United States now. We're not going to be able to build homes for every one of them. But if they need wheelchair ramps, doors widened, a room added on -- that's the kind of thing that, as homebuilders, we're going to be able to do.

Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort. Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota (pictured) is where the bishop is located .</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami-Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A drunk driver who killed a young woman in a head-on crash while checking his mobile phone has been jailed for six years. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into Rachel Titley’s car coming the other way. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27 (left) was using his mobile phone when he crashed head-on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28 (right). She died later from her injuries . The head-on crash took place in October 2013. Mr Eccleston-Todd's car was barely recognisable (pictured) Police said Eccleston-Todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Miss Titley, a 28-year-old solicitor’s clerk from Cowes, Isle of Wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. She was driving responsibly and there was ‘nothing she could have done to avoid the collision’, they added. Lindsay Pennell, prosecuting, said: ‘Craig Eccleston-Todd’s driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, Rachel Titley, a death that could have been avoided. ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left-hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of Miss Titley’s oncoming car. Miss Titley was pulled the wreckage of her Daihatsu Cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . ‘Miss Titley [had] a bright future ahead of her. She was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. ‘She had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. Her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. ‘Miss Titley’s death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand-held mobile phone whilst driving.’ Police were unable to take breath or blood tests from Eccleston-Todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink-drive limit. The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titley’s blue Daihatsu Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013. His phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. PC Mark Furse, from Hampshire constabulary’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'Our thoughts are with Rachel's family at this time. She had been out with friends at a pub in Shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. 'Our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. 'Mr Eccleston-Todd had left work in Yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. He hadn't long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. 'We weren't able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. 'The analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so it's highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.' Eccleston-Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) He added: 'Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel's family have lost her forever. 'I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they're on the road. 'The dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.' ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel’s family have lost her for ever. I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they’re on the road. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.’ Eccleston-Todd, of Newport, Isle of Wight, was also disqualified from driving for eight years after which he will have to complete an extended re-test.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- With a breezy sweep of his pen President Vladimir Putin wrote a new chapter into Crimea's turbulent history, committing the region to a future returned to Russian domain. Sixty years prior, Ukraine's breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. But dealing with such a blatant land grab on its eastern flank won't be anywhere near as quick and easy for Europe's 28-member union. Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say. After initially slapping visa restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little known politicians and military men, Europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the Russian business community in particular. The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. Alexei Navalny, one-time Moscow mayoral contender now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called for Europe's leaders to ban everyone -- from Vladimir Putin's personal banker to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. Asset freezes and visa restrictions are especially palatable options for the EU because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. In fact Russia cancels visas for people it doesn't like all the time. Just look at Hermitage Capital founder Bill Browder who lost both his right of entry and Moscow-based money in 2005 and dare not go back. Russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by Americans in retaliation for the US's implementation of an anti-corruption law named after Sergei Magnitsky, Browder's lawyer who died after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Yet in playing the 'money talks' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. Because money also walks. As such EU leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two-way street and will hurt both sides. Targeting Russia's peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for President Putin. And such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining: awarding EU countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money laundering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like London property and Picasso paintings for years. Where Europe should hold fire though is trade. Two decades of post-Soviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake. It's true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the EU - not least because 15% of the former's GDP comes from exports to the bloc. But Europe - with its hefty reliance on Russian gas - would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. And while Putin flexes his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. No one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the wane.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fleetwood are the only team still to have a 100% record in Sky Bet League One as a 2-0 win over Scunthorpe sent Graham Alexander’s men top of the table. The Cod Army are playing in the third tier for the first time in their history after six promotions in nine years and their remarkable ascent shows no sign of slowing with Jamie Proctor and Gareth Evans scoring the goals at Glanford Park. Fleetwood were one of five teams to have won two out of two but the other four clubs - Peterborough, Bristol City, Chesterfield and Crawley - all hit their first stumbling blocks. Posh were defeated 2-1 by Sheffield United, who had lost both of their opening contests. Jose Baxter’s opener gave the Blades a first-half lead, and although it was later cancelled out by Shaun Brisley’s goal, Ben Davies snatched a winner six minutes from time. In the lead: Jose Baxter (right) celebrates opening the scoring for Sheffield United . Up for the battle: Sheffield United's Michael Doyle (left) challenges Peterborough's Kyle Vassell in a keenly-contested clash . Bristol City, who beat Nigel Clough’s men on the opening day, were held to a goalless draw by last season's play-off finalists Leyton Orient while Chesterfield, the League Two champions, were beaten 1-0 by MK Dons, who play Manchester United in the Capital One Cup in seven days’ time. Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe scored the only goal of the game just after the break. Meanwhile, Crawley lost their unbeaten status, while Bradford maintained theirs, thanks to a 3-1 win for the Bantams. James Hanson became the first player to score against Crawley this season after 49 minutes before Joe Walsh equalised five minutes later. Heads up: Bristol City's Korey Smith (left) and Leyton Orient's Lloyd James go up for a header . But strikes from Billy Knott and Mason Bennett sealed an impressive away win Phil Parkinson's men. Bradford are now second behind Fleetwood after Doncaster’s stoppage-time equaliser meant Preston, for whom Joe Garner signed a new contract earlier on Tuesday, were held to a 1-1 draw which slipped them down the table. Chris Humphrey looked to have secured the points for the Lilywhites but Nathan Tyson struck a last-gasp leveller. Stand-in striker Matt Done scored a hat-trick for Rochdale in the evening’s high-scoring affair as Crewe were hammered 5-2. Marcus Haber marked his full Railwaymen debut with a brace but Done’s treble and goals from Ian Henderson and Peter Vincenti helped Keith Hill’s men to a big away victory. There were plenty of goals between Coventry and Barnsley too in a 2-2 draw with all four goals coming in the first half. Josh McQuoid and Jordan Clarke twice gave the Sky Blues the lead, but the Tykes earned a point thanks to strikes from Conor Hourihane and Leroy Lita. Notts County recorded a 2-1 home win over Colchester with Ronan Murray and Liam Noble on target. Freddie Sears replied for Colchester. James Wilson's second half equaliser earned Oldham a points against Port Vale after Tom Pope's opener and Yeovil claimed a 2-1 away victory at Walsall with Kevin Dawson striking a late winner. Tom Bradshaw had equalised after veteran James Hayter gave the Glovers the lead. Finally, Swindon held Gillingham to a 2-2 draw thanks to Stephen Bywater’s last-minute own goal. Danny Kedwell and Kortney Hause twice gave the Gills the lead but Andy Williams pulled Swindon level before Bywater dropped Raphael Branco's cross into his own net.</td>\n",

The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort. Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota (pictured) is where the bishop is located .   \n",

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.   \n",
       "2  A drunk driver who killed a young woman in a head-on crash while checking his mobile phone has been jailed for six years. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into Rachel Titley’s car coming the other way. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27 (left) was using his mobile phone when he crashed head-on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28 (right). She died later from her injuries . The head-on crash took place in October 2013. Mr Eccleston-Todd's car was barely recognisable (pictured) Police said Eccleston-Todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Miss Titley, a 28-year-old solicitor’s clerk from Cowes, Isle of Wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. She was driving responsibly and there was ‘nothing she could have done to avoid the collision’, they added. Lindsay Pennell, prosecuting, said: ‘Craig Eccleston-Todd’s driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, Rachel Titley, a death that could have been avoided. ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left-hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of Miss Titley’s oncoming car. Miss Titley was pulled the wreckage of her Daihatsu Cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . ‘Miss Titley [had] a bright future ahead of her. She was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. ‘She had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. Her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. ‘Miss Titley’s death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand-held mobile phone whilst driving.’ Police were unable to take breath or blood tests from Eccleston-Todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink-drive limit. The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titley’s blue Daihatsu Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013. His phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. PC Mark Furse, from Hampshire constabulary’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'Our thoughts are with Rachel's family at this time. She had been out with friends at a pub in Shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. 'Our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. 'Mr Eccleston-Todd had left work in Yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. He hadn't long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. 'We weren't able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. 'The analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so it's highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.' Eccleston-Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) He added: 'Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel's family have lost her forever. 'I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they're on the road. 'The dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.' ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel’s family have lost her for ever.

Sixty years prior, Ukraine's breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. But dealing with such a blatant land grab on its eastern flank won't be anywhere near as quick and easy for Europe's 28-member union. Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say. After initially slapping visa restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little known politicians and military men, Europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the Russian business community in particular. The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. Alexei Navalny, one-time Moscow mayoral contender now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called for Europe's leaders to ban everyone -- from Vladimir Putin's personal banker to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. Asset freezes and visa restrictions are especially palatable options for the EU because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. In fact Russia cancels visas for people it doesn't like all the time. Just look at Hermitage Capital founder Bill Browder who lost both his right of entry and Moscow-based money in 2005 and dare not go back. Russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by Americans in retaliation for the US's implementation of an anti-corruption law named after Sergei Magnitsky, Browder's lawyer who died after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Yet in playing the 'money talks' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. Because money also walks. As such EU leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two-way street and will hurt both sides. Targeting Russia's peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for President Putin. And such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining: awarding EU countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money laundering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like London property and Picasso paintings for years. Where Europe should hold fire though is trade. Two decades of post-Soviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake. It's true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the EU - not least because 15% of the former's GDP comes from exports to the bloc. But Europe - with its hefty reliance on Russian gas - would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. And while Putin flexes his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. No one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the wane.   \n",

The Cod Army are playing in the third tier for the first time in their history after six promotions in nine years and their remarkable ascent shows no sign of slowing with Jamie Proctor and Gareth Evans scoring the goals at Glanford Park. Fleetwood were one of five teams to have won two out of two but the other four clubs - Peterborough, Bristol City, Chesterfield and Crawley - all hit their first stumbling blocks. Posh were defeated 2-1 by Sheffield United, who had lost both of their opening contests. Jose Baxter’s opener gave the Blades a first-half lead, and although it was later cancelled out by Shaun Brisley’s goal, Ben Davies snatched a winner six minutes from time. In the lead: Jose Baxter (right) celebrates opening the scoring for Sheffield United . Up for the battle: Sheffield United's Michael Doyle (left) challenges Peterborough's Kyle Vassell in a keenly-contested clash . Bristol City, who beat Nigel Clough’s men on the opening day, were held to a goalless draw by last season's play-off finalists Leyton Orient while Chesterfield, the League Two champions, were beaten 1-0 by MK Dons, who play Manchester United in the Capital One Cup in seven days’ time. Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe scored the only goal of the game just after the break. Meanwhile, Crawley lost their unbeaten status, while Bradford maintained theirs, thanks to a 3-1 win for the Bantams. James Hanson became the first player to score against Crawley this season after 49 minutes before Joe Walsh equalised five minutes later. Heads up: Bristol City's Korey Smith (left) and Leyton Orient's Lloyd James go up for a header . But strikes from Billy Knott and Mason Bennett sealed an impressive away win Phil Parkinson's men. Bradford are now second behind Fleetwood after Doncaster’s stoppage-time equaliser meant Preston, for whom Joe Garner signed a new contract earlier on Tuesday, were held to a 1-1 draw which slipped them down the table. Chris Humphrey looked to have secured the points for the Lilywhites but Nathan Tyson struck a last-gasp leveller. Stand-in striker Matt Done scored a hat-trick for Rochdale in the evening’s high-scoring affair as Crewe were hammered 5-2. Marcus Haber marked his full Railwaymen debut with a brace but Done’s treble and goals from Ian Henderson and Peter Vincenti helped Keith Hill’s men to a big away victory. There were plenty of goals between Coventry and Barnsley too in a 2-2 draw with all four goals coming in the first half. Josh McQuoid and Jordan Clarke twice gave the Sky Blues the lead, but the Tykes earned a point thanks to strikes from Conor Hourihane and Leroy Lita. Notts County recorded a 2-1 home win over Colchester with Ronan Murray and Liam Noble on target. Freddie Sears replied for Colchester. James Wilson's second half equaliser earned Oldham a points against Port Vale after Tom Pope's opener and Yeovil claimed a 2-1 away victory at Walsall with Kevin Dawson striking a late winner. Tom Bradshaw had equalised after veteran James Hayter gave the Glovers the lead. Finally, Swindon held Gillingham to a 2-2 draw thanks to Stephen Bywater’s last-minute own goal. Danny Kedwell and Kortney Hause twice gave the Gills the lead but Andy Williams pulled Swindon level before Bywater dropped Raphael Branco's cross into his own net.   \n",

       "      <td>By . James Rush . Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has indicated she could one day be open to running for office. The only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton has said she is no longer able to completely rule out the possibility of making a political bid if, at some point, she did not support her local representatives. The 34-year-old suggested she may be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator. Scroll down for video . Future bid: Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has said she may one day consider running for office . Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her father, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, suggested she may one day be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator . In an interview, Clinton told Fast Company how ever since being a child she had always been asked about going into politics, with the answer usually being a plain 'no'. But now, she said, the answer was not so clear. She said: 'I live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected representatives. 'If at some point that weren't the case, and I didn't support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congressman or either of my senators - and I'm lucky to live in a state where I have lots of women representing me, you know - maybe then I'd have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different answer.' It is not the first time Clinton, currently vice chair of the recently rebranded Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, has spoken in these terms - she has previously given a similar response to Marlo Thomas, as published on The Huffington Post. And after delivering a keynote speech at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas last month, she said she was slowly changing her mind about whether to run for office herself in coming years, according to Buzzfeed. Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her mother, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has said she cannot completely rule out ever running for office . 'I donâ€™t know,' she said. 'For a long time, my answer to that question was no. 'At the moment I find it pretty discouraging that almost none of my friends think about running for public office as an option.' Last month, MailOnline reported on how Clinton told the tech conference what it was like growing up in one of America's most famous and powerful families - and how she learned to debate with them on major issues from the age of six. And while her father may have been the leader of the free world and her mother the U.S. Secretary of State, criss-crossing the globe solving international crises, they both needed their daughter's help to learn how to text. 'I definitely taught my parents how to text and how to charge their phones,' Chelsea Clinton said, adding the latter was 'a very mysterious thing' for her parents. Of the mock debates the family would have at home in Arkansas, she told how she would argue with one of her parents and the other would act as moderator.</td>\n",

       "      <td>An apologetic Vanilla Ice has given his first proper interview following his arrest this week, saying he is struggling to eat and sleep and that he has never felt worse. The rapper turned renovation show reality star - charged with burglary and grand theft after allegedly pilfering property from a foreclosed home in Palm Beach,  Florida - seemed teary as he said he has barely eaten or slept since turning himself into police on Wednesday. 'I'm a family man, I've got kids, I'm sorry to everybody for whatever this is,' Van Winkle told WPBP News as he left Florida for Columbus, Ohio, on Friday. 'I really love the community, where I live here in Palm Beach, I do a lot of things... hopefully people can see who I am, the real me.' Scroll down for video . 'I'm sorry to everybody': Vanilla Ice gave his first proper interview since being released from lock up earlier this week while leaving Florida on Friday bound for Columbus Ohio. He was teary, apologetic and upset . 'Worst day': The 47-year-old maintains he was trying to purchase the home that the property - left behind furniture - was stolen from, after it went into foreclosure . Van Winkle has told investigators he was 'going to purchase' the home that the stolen property was removed from. He is accused of breaking into a vacant home and stolen furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items. 'I'm still actively trying to by this house,' he told the network. 'It's just sad the way this has played out. It's not me.' 'I feel horrible. It's the worst day of my life.' The burglarized residence, which is in foreclosure, is near a home that Van Winkle was working on for his show on DIY Network, The Vanilla Ice Project, and some of the stolen property was later found at Van Winkle's personal home, police say. It has been reported however that Van Winkle told his work crew that he owned the home, and sent them over twice to burgle the property. Vanilla Ice, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was  charged with burglary of a residence and grand theft . Police say Van Winkle stole items from this house in Lantana, Florida, while he was filming his reality show inside an adjacent home . Van Winkle (center) was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond . According to the New York Daily News; 'Cops later interviewed Ice's construction foreman, who said Ice told him he'd bought the property and ordered him to fetch stuff from it, including the pool heater and two bikes, worth about $400.In the show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip houses.' Then, earlier this month, a mirrored coffee table and some glass knick-knacks were reported missing from the property. The real estate broker of the burglarized $1million home, Jim Lovely, called the situation a 'hassle', according to NBC Miami. Lovely said: 'Why would you jeopardize going to jail for basically junk? 'It was just worthless furniture and some items so it doesn't make much sense. 'The house wasn't full of Picassos, so it wasn't a high-dollar heist.' The former pop star, who rose to fame with the 1990s hit 'Ice Ice Baby,' was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond, according to WPBF. Van Winkle called the situation a 'misunderstanding' that 'was blown out of proportion'. He said: 'It's sad that good news doesn't travel this fast. 'It's just out of proportion and I wish you guys would focus on all the good things I've done. 'It'll all get cleared up, you'll see.' Authorities believe Van Winkle stole furniture, a pool heater (above), bicycles and other items . The broker for the property said the house, which did contain some furniture (above), 'wasn't full of Picassos' Police took Van Winkle into custody after they obtained a search warrant and recovered some of the stolen items at his home in Palm Beach County. The Lantana Police Department said: 'During the investigation, it was determined Robert Matthew Van Winkle played a role in the burglary and theft. 'A search warrant was obtained and executed in unincorporated Palm Beach County in which several of the stolen items were recovered at a residence under the care and control of Robert Van Winkle.' The items have been returned to their owner. In his DIY Network show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip homes. DIY is 'aware' of the situation . The items which Van Winkle allegedly took from the home (pictured) have been returned to their owner .

According to Van Winkle, the incident was not related to his television show. He said: 'I wish it was. There's nothing fun about this. 'I wish everybody all the best, and maybe some of the good news will travel this fast in the future.' DIY Network is 'aware' of the situation and 'looking into the matter'. The cable star is still scheduled to appear at the Columbus Dispatch Home and Garden Show on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio. Tommy Quon of TQ Management Agency told the Columbus Dispatch that Van Winkle will be speaking about home renovation. He said: 'Rob will be available to make the home show in Columbus. 'I still don't know what exactly happened but will get all the facts together and decide a course of action.' Van Winkle has been married to wife Laura since 1997 and they have two daughters together. This is not his first brush with the law; in 1991, he was arrested and pleaded no contest for threatening a homeless man with a gun. A decade later, he was arrested by Florida police and spent a night in jail for assaulting his wife as they argued while driving. He admitted that he had pulled her hair, but said it was to stop her from jumping out of their truck, and was sentenced to probation and attended family therapy sessions. In 2008, Van Winkle was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife again - but was released the following day after she said he had only pushed her. The case was dropped two weeks later.</td>\n",

       "      <td>America's most lethal sniper claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis despite accumulating 160 confirmed kills - with the true number estimated to be as high as 255. Speaking just months before his untimely death, Chris Kyle insisted his only regret was that US lives were lost because he shot too few of the enemy. The late veteran's wartime exploits are portrayed in the divisive Oscar-tipped movie American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood. Little regrets: In an interview three years ago America's most lethal sniper Chris Kyle claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis . Speaking to Toby Harnden of The Sunday Times three years ago, Kyle was asked whether he regretted any of his kills while on tour. Replying in his characteristically soft Texan drawl, the former sniper, said: 'No, sir, not at all. 'To be honest with you, I wish I'd killed more because every kill saved American lives and that was what I was out there for.' Kyle was thrilled by the success of his autobiographical book, which led to 'huge fascination' with the grisly art of snipers. The soldier, played by Bradley Cooper in Oscar-tipped film American Sniper (L), accumulated 160 confirmed kills in Iraq, with the true number estimated to be as high as 255 . In the 2012 interview, he added: 'It's been a taboo for too long, I'm glad that people are actually looking at it with an interest and saying these guys are actually something we need.' Less than a year after the conversation, Kyle was killed on a remote shooting range in Texas by a disturbed veteran he was helping, who was said to have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Opinion: Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper . The movie based on Kyle's book, produced by and starring Bradley Cooper, has been a box office hit, but has also divided opinion, with some criticising the film's jingoistic stance. Filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II. Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Seth Rogen also caused controversy after tweeting: 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds.' The comedy actor faced a storm of online abuse for his comment and recently issued a clarification and apology. He wrote: ‘It appears I need to further clarify a tweet I sent a few days ago. 'I said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie. 'I didn't compare the two at all. I merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other, because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers. ‘People then claimed that I compared the movie American Sniper to Nazi propaganda, something I would never do. 'I'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone, but that was not my intention. I hope this clears things up.’ Critics of the movie included talk show host Bill Maher, who claimed the film is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero. Controversy: Rogen said American Sniper (still on the right) reminded him of Nation's Pride (still on the left), a fake Nazi propaganda film from Quentin Tarantino's World War II film Inglorious Basterds . Speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, he drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'. Kid Rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by Rogen and Moore, tweeting: ‘: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.' 'Psychopath patriot - and we love him': Talk show host Bill Maher was uncompromising in his criticism of Kyle - and seized . Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's (left) movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper (right) He chose parts of the book, also called American Sniper, where Kyle said 'I love killing bad guys - even with the pain I loved what I was doing.' The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise. Maher said: 'Hurt Locker' made $17million because it was a little ambiguous and thoughtful... [American Sniper] is just \"American hero! He's a psychopath patriot, and we love him.\"' American Sniper has earned six Oscar nominations, including Best Actor for Bradley Cooper.</td>\n",

Israel has been invaded by a swarm of more than one million locusts, sending the nation into panic that the country could be plagued by the insects over the forthcoming Passover holiday. However, local chefs welcome the insects as the grasshopper-relatives are not only tasty, but also kosher. Said to taste like a mix between a sunflower seed and a baby shrimp, what may appear to be a plague, may in fact be the perfect Passover treat. Super swarm: More than one million locusts have crossed the border from Egypt to Israel . Crackdown: A man holds locusts as the swarm is tested on the Israeli border with Egypt . A swarm of an estimated 30 million . insects had been devastating crops in Egypt, putting authorities on high alert as sparrow-sized locusts began making their way . into Israel earlier this week. Reports suggest that the insects are . mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been . reported elsewhere. Chef Moshe Bassoon who cooks locusts . in his Jerusalem restaurant says he counts himself 'lucky' to have been . able to get wild insects for his eatery. 'You want them plump and meaty,' he . told The Times, suggesting different ways of cooking the insects, . including rolling them in chickpea batter and frying them in oil until . they 'turn red - like a lobster.' Holiday food: Locusts are not only delicious, local Israeli chefs say, but also kosher and the perfect treat . Damaging: A swarms of locusts fly near Kadesh Barnea, in Jerusalem, Israel, yesterday after crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt . Mr Basson ensures the winged creatures are kosher, as he himself had to prove their status to a rabbi before he began serving them at his restaurant. 'I had to bring a male and a female and the eggs to the rabbi for his examination,' he said. 'And I had to prove that there was a local tradition of Jews eating them.' The . locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which begins on March 25. It . recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, during which, according . to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God . imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews . from slavery. Pharaoh did not agree to let them go until after the 10th . plague, the death of the first born in every Egyptian family. Delicacy: While many fear the effect they may have on crops, some chefs celebrate the locusts' arrival . Israel's Agriculture Ministry sent . out planes to spray pesticides over agricultural fields earlier in the . week to prevent damage by the locusts and set up an emergency hotline . and asked Israelis to report sightings. Miriam Freund, director of plant . protection in the Agriculture Ministry, called it a 'medium-sized swarm' and her office set up a hotline for farmers to call in case they see it . advance. 'We hope our . actions are effective,' one of the pilots of a plane spraying the fields . said on Army Radio. 'Let's hope the damage will be minimal.' A bag of bugs please: A saleswoman and her wares of bamboo worms and other fried insects in northern Thailand . Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthal’s recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,’ says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat. In China beetles and roaches are sold as snacks at markets. More than 1,000 insects are eaten in 80 per cent of countries around the world - mainly those in the tropics. The tradition might be spreading to the UK as Giant Toasted Ants are already available at Selfridges for £14.99 a pack.

       "      <td>(CNN)Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has decided to \"actively explore\" a presidential bid after conversations with his family over Thanksgiving, he said in a Facebook post Tuesday. While Bush had been making steps toward a presidential bid with recent speeches in early primary states and plans to release documents from his time period as governor, the timing of Tuesday's announcement was widely unexpected and will quicken the pace for some would-be Republican primary challengers. In the post, Bush writes that over the holiday he \"talked about the future of the nation\" with his family. \"As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States,\" he said. Bush has been moving toward a run for months and in recent days sparked renewed speculation over his plans with a visit to the all-important early primary state of South Carolina to give a commencement speech Monday, and his comments in a Sunday interview that he felt he \"would be a good president.\" RELATED: Bush to grads: 'Shake things up' Democrats scoffed at his announcement. Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee suggested it was simply meant to draw press, but dismissed the possibility of a Bush run either way. \"I don't know what the difference is between 'thinking about' running and 'actively exploring' running, but I suspect it has a lot to do with keeping his name in the news,\" Elleithee said. \"However you see it, there's no parsing this simple fact: Jeb Bush has fully embraced the failed economic agenda that benefits only a select few at the expense of the middle class. That's not going to change no matter how many different ways he says he may run.\" Bush's announcement is sure to speed up the timeline for many other potential Republican presidential contenders on whether to jump in as well. Bush is seen as a top pick for establishment Republicans hoping to encourage the party to nominate a candidate they see as most electable on the national stage. Many observers believe if Bush jumps in the race, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — who's been mentored by Bush since his entry into Florida politics — wouldn't run. And he'd likely make it tougher for some of the more establishment-minded governors, like Texas Gov. Rick Perry or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, to find footing in the race. However, a source near Rubio said Tuesday that while Bush's announcement changes the dynamic of the race, the junior Florida Senator is still \"on track to run for president\" in 2016. And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has been actively preparing for a bid and would likely run to Bush's right flank, also seemed nonplussed by the announcement. \"I think we're a big tent -- we can use moderates, conservatives, libertarians — we need em all,\" he told reporters walking into the Capitol. Asked whether he could win the nomination, Paul demurred. \"I think the more the merrier -- the public will determine that.\" Bush added in Tuesday's post that he hopes \"to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of America\" in the coming months. RELATED: 6 things to know about Jeb Bush . Bush also announced the creation of a PAC, which will aim to \"support leaders, ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans.\" He added that the PAC would \"facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation.\" On Sunday, Bush also announced plans to release about 250,000 emails from his time in office and an upcoming e-book about his time as governor, moves seen as efforts to re-introduce Americans to his governing chops in preparation to emerge as a more prominent player on the national stage. If he does make his bid official, he'll likely face fierce opposition from conservatives in the primary, who have long been frustrated with his advocacy for Common Core educational standards and his support for a more moderate vision of immigration reform. RELATED: Bush releases 250,000 emails . He's previously expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, though he's wavered in that support since. And while he's come out in opposition to President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, he's also urged Republicans to act on immigration reform \"rather than have their heads explode.\" That moderation on immigration reform — and his diverse family, as his wife was born in Mexico and he speaks fluent Spanish — have many in the GOP hopeful Bush could help the party overcome some of their deficit with Hispanic voters, which has proven to be problematic for them in national races. Despite the likely conservative opposition, Bush has hinted he wouldn't shift to the far-right to please GOP primary voters if he runs. During the Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting earlier this month, Bush warned that the GOP presidential nominee shouldn't \"lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles.\" The comments came as the conservative and more centrist wings of the GOP continue to debate a path forward for the party, with many on the right arguing former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost in 2012 because he didn't stand strong enough on conservative principles. But Romney and Bush, despite the conservative criticism, remain two of the most popular figures in the party, and indeed both led the recent McClatchy-Marist national poll of the potential GOP presidential field. Romney took 19 percent, while Bush came in second with 14 percent support; with Romney out of the race, Bush would lead with 16 percent support, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 12 percent. Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.</td>\n",

James Rush . Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has indicated she could one day be open to running for office. The only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton has said she is no longer able to completely rule out the possibility of making a political bid if, at some point, she did not support her local representatives. The 34-year-old suggested she may be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator. Scroll down for video . Future bid: Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has said she may one day consider running for office . Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her father, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, suggested she may one day be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator . In an interview, Clinton told Fast Company how ever since being a child she had always been asked about going into politics, with the answer usually being a plain 'no'. But now, she said, the answer was not so clear. She said: 'I live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected representatives. 'If at some point that weren't the case, and I didn't support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congressman or either of my senators - and I'm lucky to live in a state where I have lots of women representing me, you know - maybe then I'd have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different answer.' It is not the first time Clinton, currently vice chair of the recently rebranded Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, has spoken in these terms - she has previously given a similar response to Marlo Thomas, as published on The Huffington Post. And after delivering a keynote speech at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas last month, she said she was slowly changing her mind about whether to run for office herself in coming years, according to Buzzfeed. Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her mother, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has said she cannot completely rule out ever running for office . 'I donâ€™t know,' she said. 'For a long time, my answer to that question was no. 'At the moment I find it pretty discouraging that almost none of my friends think about running for public office as an option.' Last month, MailOnline reported on how Clinton told the tech conference what it was like growing up in one of America's most famous and powerful families - and how she learned to debate with them on major issues from the age of six. And while her father may have been the leader of the free world and her mother the U.S. Secretary of State, criss-crossing the globe solving international crises, they both needed their daughter's help to learn how to text. 'I definitely taught my parents how to text and how to charge their phones,' Chelsea Clinton said, adding the latter was 'a very mysterious thing' for her parents. Of the mock debates the family would have at home in Arkansas, she told how she would argue with one of her parents and the other would act as moderator.   \n",
       "287109  An apologetic Vanilla Ice has given his first proper interview following his arrest this week, saying he is struggling to eat and sleep and that he has never felt worse. The rapper turned renovation show reality star - charged with burglary and grand theft after allegedly pilfering property from a foreclosed home in Palm Beach,  Florida - seemed teary as he said he has barely eaten or slept since turning himself into police on Wednesday. 'I'm a family man, I've got kids, I'm sorry to everybody for whatever this is,' Van Winkle told WPBP News as he left Florida for Columbus, Ohio, on Friday. 'I really love the community, where I live here in Palm Beach, I do a lot of things... hopefully people can see who I am, the real me.' Scroll down for video . 'I'm sorry to everybody': Vanilla Ice gave his first proper interview since being released from lock up earlier this week while leaving Florida on Friday bound for Columbus Ohio. He was teary, apologetic and upset . 'Worst day': The 47-year-old maintains he was trying to purchase the home that the property - left behind furniture - was stolen from, after it went into foreclosure . Van Winkle has told investigators he was 'going to purchase' the home that the stolen property was removed from. He is accused of breaking into a vacant home and stolen furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items. 'I'm still actively trying to by this house,' he told the network. 'It's just sad the way this has played out. It's not me.' 'I feel horrible. It's the worst day of my life.' The burglarized residence, which is in foreclosure, is near a home that Van Winkle was working on for his show on DIY Network, The Vanilla Ice Project, and some of the stolen property was later found at Van Winkle's personal home, police say. It has been reported however that Van Winkle told his work crew that he owned the home, and sent them over twice to burgle the property. Vanilla Ice, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was  charged with burglary of a residence and grand theft . Police say Van Winkle stole items from this house in Lantana, Florida, while he was filming his reality show inside an adjacent home . Van Winkle (center) was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond . According to the New York Daily News; 'Cops later interviewed Ice's construction foreman, who said Ice told him he'd bought the property and ordered him to fetch stuff from it, including the pool heater and two bikes, worth about $400.In the show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip houses.' Then, earlier this month, a mirrored coffee table and some glass knick-knacks were reported missing from the property. The real estate broker of the burglarized $1million home, Jim Lovely, called the situation a 'hassle', according to NBC Miami. Lovely said: 'Why would you jeopardize going to jail for basically junk? 'It was just worthless furniture and some items so it doesn't make much sense. 'The house wasn't full of Picassos, so it wasn't a high-dollar heist.' The former pop star, who rose to fame with the 1990s hit 'Ice Ice Baby,' was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond, according to WPBF. Van Winkle called the situation a 'misunderstanding' that 'was blown out of proportion'. He said: 'It's sad that good news doesn't travel this fast. 'It's just out of proportion and I wish you guys would focus on all the good things I've done. 'It'll all get cleared up, you'll see.' Authorities believe Van Winkle stole furniture, a pool heater (above), bicycles and other items . The broker for the property said the house, which did contain some furniture (above), 'wasn't full of Picassos' Police took Van Winkle into custody after they obtained a search warrant and recovered some of the stolen items at his home in Palm Beach County. The Lantana Police Department said: 'During the investigation, it was determined Robert Matthew Van Winkle played a role in the burglary and theft. 'A search warrant was obtained and executed in unincorporated Palm Beach County in which several of the stolen items were recovered at a residence under the care and control of Robert Van Winkle.' The items have been returned to their owner. In his DIY Network show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip homes. DIY is 'aware' of the situation . The items which Van Winkle allegedly took from the home (pictured) have been returned to their owner . Van Winkle in a 2001 mugshot (left) after he allegedly threatened a man and in a 2008 mugshot (right) after an assault charge . According to Van Winkle, the incident was not related to his television show. He said: 'I wish it was. There's nothing fun about this. 'I wish everybody all the best, and maybe some of the good news will travel this fast in the future.' DIY Network is 'aware' of the situation and 'looking into the matter'. The cable star is still scheduled to appear at the Columbus Dispatch Home and Garden Show on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio. Tommy Quon of TQ Management Agency told the Columbus Dispatch that Van Winkle will be speaking about home renovation. He said: 'Rob will be available to make the home show in Columbus. 'I still don't know what exactly happened but will get all the facts together and decide a course of action.' Van Winkle has been married to wife Laura since 1997 and they have two daughters together. This is not his first brush with the law; in 1991, he was arrested and pleaded no contest for threatening a homeless man with a gun. A decade later, he was arrested by Florida police and spent a night in jail for assaulting his wife as they argued while driving. He admitted that he had pulled her hair, but said it was to stop her from jumping out of their truck, and was sentenced to probation and attended family therapy sessions. In 2008, Van Winkle was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife again - but was released the following day after she said he had only pushed her. The case was dropped two weeks later.   \n",

Speaking just months before his untimely death, Chris Kyle insisted his only regret was that US lives were lost because he shot too few of the enemy. The late veteran's wartime exploits are portrayed in the divisive Oscar-tipped movie American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood. Little regrets: In an interview three years ago America's most lethal sniper Chris Kyle claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis . Speaking to Toby Harnden of The Sunday Times three years ago, Kyle was asked whether he regretted any of his kills while on tour. Replying in his characteristically soft Texan drawl, the former sniper, said: 'No, sir, not at all. 'To be honest with you, I wish I'd killed more because every kill saved American lives and that was what I was out there for.' Kyle was thrilled by the success of his autobiographical book, which led to 'huge fascination' with the grisly art of snipers. The soldier, played by Bradley Cooper in Oscar-tipped film American Sniper (L), accumulated 160 confirmed kills in Iraq, with the true number estimated to be as high as 255 . In the 2012 interview, he added: 'It's been a taboo for too long, I'm glad that people are actually looking at it with an interest and saying these guys are actually something we need.' Less than a year after the conversation, Kyle was killed on a remote shooting range in Texas by a disturbed veteran he was helping, who was said to have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Opinion: Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper . The movie based on Kyle's book, produced by and starring Bradley Cooper, has been a box office hit, but has also divided opinion, with some criticising the film's jingoistic stance. Filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II. Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Seth Rogen also caused controversy after tweeting: 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds.' The comedy actor faced a storm of online abuse for his comment and recently issued a clarification and apology. He wrote: ‘It appears I need to further clarify a tweet I sent a few days ago. 'I said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie. 'I didn't compare the two at all. I merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other, because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers. ‘People then claimed that I compared the movie American Sniper to Nazi propaganda, something I would never do. 'I'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone, but that was not my intention. I hope this clears things up.’ Critics of the movie included talk show host Bill Maher, who claimed the film is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero. Controversy: Rogen said American Sniper (still on the right) reminded him of Nation's Pride (still on the left), a fake Nazi propaganda film from Quentin Tarantino's World War II film Inglorious Basterds . Speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, he drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'. Kid Rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by Rogen and Moore, tweeting: ‘: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.' 'Psychopath patriot - and we love him': Talk show host Bill Maher was uncompromising in his criticism of Kyle - and seized . Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's (left) movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper (right) He chose parts of the book, also called American Sniper, where Kyle said 'I love killing bad guys - even with the pain I loved what I was doing.' The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise. Maher said: 'Hurt Locker' made $17million because it was a little ambiguous and thoughtful... [American Sniper] is just \"American hero! He's a psychopath patriot, and we love him.\"' American Sniper has earned six Oscar nominations, including Best Actor for Bradley Cooper.   \n",

Israel has been invaded by a swarm of more than one million locusts, sending the nation into panic that the country could be plagued by the insects over the forthcoming Passover holiday. However, local chefs welcome the insects as the grasshopper-relatives are not only tasty, but also kosher. Said to taste like a mix between a sunflower seed and a baby shrimp, what may appear to be a plague, may in fact be the perfect Passover treat. Super swarm: More than one million locusts have crossed the border from Egypt to Israel . Crackdown: A man holds locusts as the swarm is tested on the Israeli border with Egypt . A swarm of an estimated 30 million . insects had been devastating crops in Egypt, putting authorities on high alert as sparrow-sized locusts began making their way . into Israel earlier this week. Reports suggest that the insects are . mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been . reported elsewhere. Chef Moshe Bassoon who cooks locusts . in his Jerusalem restaurant says he counts himself 'lucky' to have been . able to get wild insects for his eatery. 'You want them plump and meaty,' he . told The Times, suggesting different ways of cooking the insects, . including rolling them in chickpea batter and frying them in oil until . they 'turn red - like a lobster.' Holiday food: Locusts are not only delicious, local Israeli chefs say, but also kosher and the perfect treat . Damaging: A swarms of locusts fly near Kadesh Barnea, in Jerusalem, Israel, yesterday after crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt . Mr Basson ensures the winged creatures are kosher, as he himself had to prove their status to a rabbi before he began serving them at his restaurant. 'I had to bring a male and a female and the eggs to the rabbi for his examination,' he said. 'And I had to prove that there was a local tradition of Jews eating them.' The . locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which begins on March 25. It . recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, during which, according . to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God . imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews . from slavery. Pharaoh did not agree to let them go until after the 10th . plague, the death of the first born in every Egyptian family. Delicacy: While many fear the effect they may have on crops, some chefs celebrate the locusts' arrival . Israel's Agriculture Ministry sent . out planes to spray pesticides over agricultural fields earlier in the . week to prevent damage by the locusts and set up an emergency hotline . and asked Israelis to report sightings. Miriam Freund, director of plant . protection in the Agriculture Ministry, called it a 'medium-sized swarm' and her office set up a hotline for farmers to call in case they see it . advance. 'We hope our . actions are effective,' one of the pilots of a plane spraying the fields . said on Army Radio. 'Let's hope the damage will be minimal.' A bag of bugs please: A saleswoman and her wares of bamboo worms and other fried insects in northern Thailand . Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthal’s recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,’ says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat. In China beetles and roaches are sold as snacks at markets. More than 1,000 insects are eaten in 80 per cent of countries around the world - mainly those in the tropics. The tradition might be spreading to the UK as Giant Toasted Ants are already available at Selfridges for £14.99 a pack.

       "287112                                                                                             (CNN)Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has decided to \"actively explore\" a presidential bid after conversations with his family over Thanksgiving, he said in a Facebook post Tuesday. While Bush had been making steps toward a presidential bid with recent speeches in early primary states and plans to release documents from his time period as governor, the timing of Tuesday's announcement was widely unexpected and will quicken the pace for some would-be Republican primary challengers. In the post, Bush writes that over the holiday he \"talked about the future of the nation\" with his family. \"As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States,\" he said. Bush has been moving toward a run for months and in recent days sparked renewed speculation over his plans with a visit to the all-important early primary state of South Carolina to give a commencement speech Monday, and his comments in a Sunday interview that he felt he \"would be a good president.\" RELATED: Bush to grads: 'Shake things up' Democrats scoffed at his announcement. Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee suggested it was simply meant to draw press, but dismissed the possibility of a Bush run either way. \"I don't know what the difference is between 'thinking about' running and 'actively exploring' running, but I suspect it has a lot to do with keeping his name in the news,\" Elleithee said. \"However you see it, there's no parsing this simple fact: Jeb Bush has fully embraced the failed economic agenda that benefits only a select few at the expense of the middle class. That's not going to change no matter how many different ways he says he may run.\" Bush's announcement is sure to speed up the timeline for many other potential Republican presidential contenders on whether to jump in as well. Bush is seen as a top pick for establishment Republicans hoping to encourage the party to nominate a candidate they see as most electable on the national stage. Many observers believe if Bush jumps in the race, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — who's been mentored by Bush since his entry into Florida politics — wouldn't run. And he'd likely make it tougher for some of the more establishment-minded governors, like Texas Gov. Rick Perry or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, to find footing in the race. However, a source near Rubio said Tuesday that while Bush's announcement changes the dynamic of the race, the junior Florida Senator is still \"on track to run for president\" in 2016. And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has been actively preparing for a bid and would likely run to Bush's right flank, also seemed nonplussed by the announcement. \"I think we're a big tent -- we can use moderates, conservatives, libertarians — we need em all,\" he told reporters walking into the Capitol. Asked whether he could win the nomination, Paul demurred. \"I think the more the merrier -- the public will determine that.\" Bush added in Tuesday's post that he hopes \"to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of America\" in the coming months. RELATED: 6 things to know about Jeb Bush . Bush also announced the creation of a PAC, which will aim to \"support leaders, ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans.\" He added that the PAC would \"facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation.\" On Sunday, Bush also announced plans to release about 250,000 emails from his time in office and an upcoming e-book about his time as governor, moves seen as efforts to re-introduce Americans to his governing chops in preparation to emerge as a more prominent player on the national stage. If he does make his bid official, he'll likely face fierce opposition from conservatives in the primary, who have long been frustrated with his advocacy for Common Core educational standards and his support for a more moderate vision of immigration reform. RELATED: Bush releases 250,000 emails . He's previously expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, though he's wavered in that support since. And while he's come out in opposition to President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, he's also urged Republicans to act on immigration reform \"rather than have their heads explode.\" That moderation on immigration reform — and his diverse family, as his wife was born in Mexico and he speaks fluent Spanish — have many in the GOP hopeful Bush could help the party overcome some of their deficit with Hispanic voters, which has proven to be problematic for them in national races. Despite the likely conservative opposition, Bush has hinted he wouldn't shift to the far-right to please GOP primary voters if he runs. During the Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting earlier this month, Bush warned that the GOP presidential nominee shouldn't \"lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles.\" The comments came as the conservative and more centrist wings of the GOP continue to debate a path forward for the party, with many on the right arguing former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost in 2012 because he didn't stand strong enough on conservative principles. But Romney and Bush, despite the conservative criticism, remain two of the most popular figures in the party, and indeed both led the recent McClatchy-Marist national poll of the potential GOP presidential field. Romney took 19 percent, while Bush came in second with 14 percent support; with Romney out of the race, Bush would lead with 16 percent support, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 12 percent. Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.   \n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Dubai could lose its place on the Women's Tennis Association Tour calendar after Israeli Shahar Peer was denied entry to compete at this week's event, the WTA supremo warned Monday. Shahar Peer told CNN she learned of her visa ban Saturday, just before her scheduled flight to Dubai. Peer was scheduled to fly into the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, but was informed Saturday night by telephone that she would not be granted a visa. WTA Chairman and CEO Larry Scott said the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour \"will review appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament.\" Scott added: \"The Sony Ericsson WTA Tour believes very strongly, and has a clear rule and policy, that no host country should deny a player the right to compete at a tournament for which she has qualified by ranking.\" Peer, who had just finished playing in the Pattaya Open in Thailand, where she reached the semifinal, said she is \"very, very disappointed\" to have been denied the opportunity to play in Dubai. \"They really stopped my momentum because now I'm not going to play for two weeks and because they waited for the last minute I couldn't go to another tournament either,\" Peer said from Tel Aviv. \"So it's very disappointing, and I think it's not fair.\" Watch Peer describe her disappointment » . Scott, meanwhile, confirmed: \"Following various consultations, the Tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the Tour's Board of Directors. \"Ms. Peer and her family are obviously extremely upset and disappointed by the decision of the UAE and its impact on her personally and professionally, and the Tour is reviewing appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer.\" Scott said Peer's visa refusal has precedence: Last year an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry to Dubai. He said the Emirate cited security reasons following recent unrest in the region. \"At that time I was in Dubai. I made it clear to the authorities, the representatives of the government, that next year when our top players wanted to play this very prestigious tournament all of them had to be allowed to play,\" Scott said. \"They had a year to work on it and solve it. We've spent time through the year discussing it. We were given assurances that it had gone to the highest levels of government,\" Scott said. \"I was optimistic they would solve it. And we've made crystal clear to the government, to the tournament organizers that there could be grave repercussions not just for tennis in the UAE but sports beyond that.\"  Watch CNN's interview with Larry Scott » . The Dubai government issued a short statement through the state-owned news agency, saying that Peer was informed while in Thailand that she would not receive a visa. The agency quoted an official source in the organizing committee saying, \"The tournament is sponsored by several national organizations and they all care to be part of a successful tournament, considering the developments that the region had been through.\" Earlier an official source who did not want to be named, said, \"We should check what happened in New Zealand, when Peer was playing there with all the demonstrations against Israel during the attacks on Gaza. We have to consider securing the players and the tournament.\" In January, a small group of about 20 protestors waved placards and shouted anti-Israel slogans outside the main entrance to the ASB Classic tournament in Auckland. They were moved on before Peer played her match. The Israeli player said she's received phone calls of support from her fellow players. \"'All the players support Shahar,\" world No. 6 Venus Williams told The New York Times, adding, \"We are all athletes, and we stand for tennis.\" Peer is uncertain of her next move. She said the last-minute decision had left her at a loose end. She said she was concerned about her points and ranking and may go to the U.S. this week to try to take part in another tournament. \"I don't think it should happen,\" she said. \"I think sport and politics needs to stay on the side and not be involved. I really hope it's not going to happen again, not only to me but to any other athlete.\" CNN Dubai bureau chief Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .</td>\n",

       "top     (CNN) -- Dubai could lose its place on the Women's Tennis Association Tour calendar after Israeli Shahar Peer was denied entry to compete at this week's event, the WTA supremo warned Monday. Shahar Peer told CNN she learned of her visa ban Saturday, just before her scheduled flight to Dubai. Peer was scheduled to fly into the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, but was informed Saturday night by telephone that she would not be granted a visa. WTA Chairman and CEO Larry Scott said the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour \"will review appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament.\" Scott added: \"The Sony Ericsson WTA Tour believes very strongly, and has a clear rule and policy, that no host country should deny a player the right to compete at a tournament for which she has qualified by ranking.\" Peer, who had just finished playing in the Pattaya Open in Thailand, where she reached the semifinal, said she is \"very, very disappointed\" to have been denied the opportunity to play in Dubai. \"They really stopped my momentum because now I'm not going to play for two weeks and because they waited for the last minute I couldn't go to another tournament either,\" Peer said from Tel Aviv. \"So it's very disappointing, and I think it's not fair.\" Watch Peer describe her disappointment » . Scott, meanwhile, confirmed: \"Following various consultations, the Tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the Tour's Board of Directors. \"Ms. Peer and her family are obviously extremely upset and disappointed by the decision of the UAE and its impact on her personally and professionally, and the Tour is reviewing appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer.\" Scott said Peer's visa refusal has precedence: Last year an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry to Dubai. He said the Emirate cited security reasons following recent unrest in the region. \"At that time I was in Dubai. I made it clear to the authorities, the representatives of the government, that next year when our top players wanted to play this very prestigious tournament all of them had to be allowed to play,\" Scott said. \"They had a year to work on it and solve it. We've spent time through the year discussing it. We were given assurances that it had gone to the highest levels of government,\" Scott said. \"I was optimistic they would solve it. And we've made crystal clear to the government, to the tournament organizers that there could be grave repercussions not just for tennis in the UAE but sports beyond that.\"  Watch CNN's interview with Larry Scott » . The Dubai government issued a short statement through the state-owned news agency, saying that Peer was informed while in Thailand that she would not receive a visa. The agency quoted an official source in the organizing committee saying, \"The tournament is sponsored by several national organizations and they all care to be part of a successful tournament, considering the developments that the region had been through.\" Earlier an official source who did not want to be named, said, \"We should check what happened in New Zealand, when Peer was playing there with all the demonstrations against Israel during the attacks on Gaza. We have to consider securing the players and the tournament.\" In January, a small group of about 20 protestors waved placards and shouted anti-Israel slogans outside the main entrance to the ASB Classic tournament in Auckland. They were moved on before Peer played her match. The Israeli player said she's received phone calls of support from her fellow players. \"'All the players support Shahar,\" world No. 6 Venus Williams told The New York Times, adding, \"We are all athletes, and we stand for tennis.\" Peer is uncertain of her next move. She said the last-minute decision had left her at a loose end. She said she was concerned about her points and ranking and may go to the U.S. this week to try to take part in another tournament. \"I don't think it should happen,\" she said. \"I think sport and politics needs to stay on the side and not be involved. I really hope it's not going to happen again, not only to me but to any other athlete.\" CNN Dubai bureau chief Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .   \n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Dubai could lose its place on the Women's Tennis Association Tour calendar after Israeli Shahar Peer was denied entry to compete at this week's event, the WTA supremo warned Monday. Shahar Peer told CNN she learned of her visa ban Saturday, just before her scheduled flight to Dubai. Peer was scheduled to fly into the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, but was informed Saturday night by telephone that she would not be granted a visa. WTA Chairman and CEO Larry Scott said the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour \"will review appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament.\" Scott added: \"The Sony Ericsson WTA Tour believes very strongly, and has a clear rule and policy, that no host country should deny a player the right to compete at a tournament for which she has qualified by ranking.\" Peer, who had just finished playing in the Pattaya Open in Thailand, where she reached the semifinal, said she is \"very, very disappointed\" to have been denied the opportunity to play in Dubai. \"They really stopped my momentum because now I'm not going to play for two weeks and because they waited for the last minute I couldn't go to another tournament either,\" Peer said from Tel Aviv. \"So it's very disappointing, and I think it's not fair.\" Watch Peer describe her disappointment » . Scott, meanwhile, confirmed: \"Following various consultations, the Tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the Tour's Board of Directors. \"Ms. Peer and her family are obviously extremely upset and disappointed by the decision of the UAE and its impact on her personally and professionally, and the Tour is reviewing appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer.\" Scott said Peer's visa refusal has precedence: Last year an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry to Dubai. He said the Emirate cited security reasons following recent unrest in the region. \"At that time I was in Dubai. I made it clear to the authorities, the representatives of the government, that next year when our top players wanted to play this very prestigious tournament all of them had to be allowed to play,\" Scott said. \"They had a year to work on it and solve it. We've spent time through the year discussing it. We were given assurances that it had gone to the highest levels of government,\" Scott said. \"I was optimistic they would solve it. And we've made crystal clear to the government, to the tournament organizers that there could be grave repercussions not just for tennis in the UAE but sports beyond that.\"  Watch CNN's interview with Larry Scott » . The Dubai government issued a short statement through the state-owned news agency, saying that Peer was informed while in Thailand that she would not receive a visa. The agency quoted an official source in the organizing committee saying, \"The tournament is sponsored by several national organizations and they all care to be part of a successful tournament, considering the developments that the region had been through.\" Earlier an official source who did not want to be named, said, \"We should check what happened in New Zealand, when Peer was playing there with all the demonstrations against Israel during the attacks on Gaza. We have to consider securing the players and the tournament.\" In January, a small group of about 20 protestors waved placards and shouted anti-Israel slogans outside the main entrance to the ASB Classic tournament in Auckland. They were moved on before Peer played her match. The Israeli player said she's received phone calls of support from her fellow players. \"'All the players support Shahar,\" world No. 6 Venus Williams told The New York Times, adding, \"We are all athletes, and we stand for tennis.\" Peer is uncertain of her next move. She said the last-minute decision had left her at a loose end. She said she was concerned about her points and ranking and may go to the U.S. this week to try to take part in another tournament. \"I don't think it should happen,\" she said. \"I think sport and politics needs to stay on the side and not be involved. I really hope it's not going to happen again, not only to me but to any other athlete.\" CNN Dubai bureau chief Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .</td>\n",

       "article     (CNN) -- Dubai could lose its place on the Women's Tennis Association Tour calendar after Israeli Shahar Peer was denied entry to compete at this week's event, the WTA supremo warned Monday. Shahar Peer told CNN she learned of her visa ban Saturday, just before her scheduled flight to Dubai. Peer was scheduled to fly into the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, but was informed Saturday night by telephone that she would not be granted a visa. WTA Chairman and CEO Larry Scott said the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour \"will review appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament.\" Scott added: \"The Sony Ericsson WTA Tour believes very strongly, and has a clear rule and policy, that no host country should deny a player the right to compete at a tournament for which she has qualified by ranking.\" Peer, who had just finished playing in the Pattaya Open in Thailand, where she reached the semifinal, said she is \"very, very disappointed\" to have been denied the opportunity to play in Dubai. \"They really stopped my momentum because now I'm not going to play for two weeks and because they waited for the last minute I couldn't go to another tournament either,\" Peer said from Tel Aviv. \"So it's very disappointing, and I think it's not fair.\" Watch Peer describe her disappointment » . Scott, meanwhile, confirmed: \"Following various consultations, the Tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the Tour's Board of Directors. \"Ms. Peer and her family are obviously extremely upset and disappointed by the decision of the UAE and its impact on her personally and professionally, and the Tour is reviewing appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer.\" Scott said Peer's visa refusal has precedence: Last year an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry to Dubai. He said the Emirate cited security reasons following recent unrest in the region. \"At that time I was in Dubai. I made it clear to the authorities, the representatives of the government, that next year when our top players wanted to play this very prestigious tournament all of them had to be allowed to play,\" Scott said. \"They had a year to work on it and solve it. We've spent time through the year discussing it. We were given assurances that it had gone to the highest levels of government,\" Scott said. \"I was optimistic they would solve it. And we've made crystal clear to the government, to the tournament organizers that there could be grave repercussions not just for tennis in the UAE but sports beyond that.\"  Watch CNN's interview with Larry Scott » . The Dubai government issued a short statement through the state-owned news agency, saying that Peer was informed while in Thailand that she would not receive a visa. The agency quoted an official source in the organizing committee saying, \"The tournament is sponsored by several national organizations and they all care to be part of a successful tournament, considering the developments that the region had been through.\" Earlier an official source who did not want to be named, said, \"We should check what happened in New Zealand, when Peer was playing there with all the demonstrations against Israel during the attacks on Gaza. We have to consider securing the players and the tournament.\" In January, a small group of about 20 protestors waved placards and shouted anti-Israel slogans outside the main entrance to the ASB Classic tournament in Auckland. They were moved on before Peer played her match. The Israeli player said she's received phone calls of support from her fellow players. \"'All the players support Shahar,\" world No. 6 Venus Williams told The New York Times, adding, \"We are all athletes, and we stand for tennis.\" Peer is uncertain of her next move. She said the last-minute decision had left her at a loose end. She said she was concerned about her points and ranking and may go to the U.S. this week to try to take part in another tournament. \"I don't think it should happen,\" she said. \"I think sport and politics needs to stay on the side and not be involved. I really hope it's not going to happen again, not only to me but to any other athlete.\" CNN Dubai bureau chief Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .   \n",

The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort. Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota (pictured) is where the bishop is located .</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami-Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A drunk driver who killed a young woman in a head-on crash while checking his mobile phone has been jailed for six years. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into Rachel Titley’s car coming the other way. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27 (left) was using his mobile phone when he crashed head-on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28 (right). She died later from her injuries . The head-on crash took place in October 2013. Mr Eccleston-Todd's car was barely recognisable (pictured) Police said Eccleston-Todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Miss Titley, a 28-year-old solicitor’s clerk from Cowes, Isle of Wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. She was driving responsibly and there was ‘nothing she could have done to avoid the collision’, they added. Lindsay Pennell, prosecuting, said: ‘Craig Eccleston-Todd’s driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, Rachel Titley, a death that could have been avoided. ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left-hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of Miss Titley’s oncoming car. Miss Titley was pulled the wreckage of her Daihatsu Cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . ‘Miss Titley [had] a bright future ahead of her. She was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. ‘She had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. Her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. ‘Miss Titley’s death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand-held mobile phone whilst driving.’ Police were unable to take breath or blood tests from Eccleston-Todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink-drive limit. The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titley’s blue Daihatsu Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013. His phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. PC Mark Furse, from Hampshire constabulary’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'Our thoughts are with Rachel's family at this time. She had been out with friends at a pub in Shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. 'Our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. 'Mr Eccleston-Todd had left work in Yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. He hadn't long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. 'We weren't able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. 'The analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so it's highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.' Eccleston-Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) He added: 'Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel's family have lost her forever. 'I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they're on the road. 'The dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.' ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel’s family have lost her for ever. I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they’re on the road. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.’ Eccleston-Todd, of Newport, Isle of Wight, was also disqualified from driving for eight years after which he will have to complete an extended re-test.</td>\n",

The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort. Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota (pictured) is where the bishop is located .\n",

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.\n",
       "2  A drunk driver who killed a young woman in a head-on crash while checking his mobile phone has been jailed for six years. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into Rachel Titley’s car coming the other way. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27 (left) was using his mobile phone when he crashed head-on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28 (right). She died later from her injuries . The head-on crash took place in October 2013. Mr Eccleston-Todd's car was barely recognisable (pictured) Police said Eccleston-Todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Miss Titley, a 28-year-old solicitor’s clerk from Cowes, Isle of Wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. She was driving responsibly and there was ‘nothing she could have done to avoid the collision’, they added. Lindsay Pennell, prosecuting, said: ‘Craig Eccleston-Todd’s driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, Rachel Titley, a death that could have been avoided. ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left-hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of Miss Titley’s oncoming car. Miss Titley was pulled the wreckage of her Daihatsu Cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . ‘Miss Titley [had] a bright future ahead of her. She was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. ‘She had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. Her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. ‘Miss Titley’s death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand-held mobile phone whilst driving.’ Police were unable to take breath or blood tests from Eccleston-Todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink-drive limit. The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titley’s blue Daihatsu Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013. His phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. PC Mark Furse, from Hampshire constabulary’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'Our thoughts are with Rachel's family at this time. She had been out with friends at a pub in Shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. 'Our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. 'Mr Eccleston-Todd had left work in Yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. He hadn't long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. 'We weren't able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. 'The analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so it's highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.' Eccleston-Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) He added: 'Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel's family have lost her forever. 'I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they're on the road. 'The dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.' ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel’s family have lost her for ever. I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they’re on the road. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.’ Eccleston-Todd, of Newport, Isle of Wight, was also disqualified from driving for eight years after which he will have to complete an extended re-test."

       "      <td>By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:11 EST, 25 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:36 EST, 25 October 2013 . The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort. Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota (pictured) is where the bishop is located .</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)   Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45 year old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K 9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "1  (CNN)   Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45 year old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K 9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.  "

The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort. Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota (pictured) is where the bishop is located .\n",

       "article                 By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 12:19 EST, 8 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:05 EST, 8 March 2013 . Israel has been invaded by a swarm of more than one million locusts, sending the nation into panic that the country could be plagued by the insects over the forthcoming Passover holiday. However, local chefs welcome the insects as the grasshopper-relatives are not only tasty, but also kosher. Said to taste like a mix between a sunflower seed and a baby shrimp, what may appear to be a plague, may in fact be the perfect Passover treat. Super swarm: More than one million locusts have crossed the border from Egypt to Israel . Crackdown: A man holds locusts as the swarm is tested on the Israeli border with Egypt . A swarm of an estimated 30 million . insects had been devastating crops in Egypt, putting authorities on high alert as sparrow-sized locusts began making their way . into Israel earlier this week. Reports suggest that the insects are . mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been . reported elsewhere. Chef Moshe Bassoon who cooks locusts . in his Jerusalem restaurant says he counts himself 'lucky' to have been . able to get wild insects for his eatery. 'You want them plump and meaty,' he . told The Times, suggesting different ways of cooking the insects, . including rolling them in chickpea batter and frying them in oil until . they 'turn red - like a lobster.' Holiday food: Locusts are not only delicious, local Israeli chefs say, but also kosher and the perfect treat . Damaging: A swarms of locusts fly near Kadesh Barnea, in Jerusalem, Israel, yesterday after crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt . Mr Basson ensures the winged creatures are kosher, as he himself had to prove their status to a rabbi before he began serving them at his restaurant. 'I had to bring a male and a female and the eggs to the rabbi for his examination,' he said. 'And I had to prove that there was a local tradition of Jews eating them.' The . locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which begins on March 25. It . recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, during which, according . to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God . imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews . from slavery. Pharaoh did not agree to let them go until after the 10th . plague, the death of the first born in every Egyptian family. Delicacy: While many fear the effect they may have on crops, some chefs celebrate the locusts' arrival . Israel's Agriculture Ministry sent . out planes to spray pesticides over agricultural fields earlier in the . week to prevent damage by the locusts and set up an emergency hotline . and asked Israelis to report sightings. Miriam Freund, director of plant . protection in the Agriculture Ministry, called it a 'medium-sized swarm' and her office set up a hotline for farmers to call in case they see it . advance. 'We hope our . actions are effective,' one of the pilots of a plane spraying the fields . said on Army Radio. 'Let's hope the damage will be minimal.' A bag of bugs please: A saleswoman and her wares of bamboo worms and other fried insects in northern Thailand . Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthal’s recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,’ says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat. In China beetles and roaches are sold as snacks at markets. More than 1,000 insects are eaten in 80 per cent of countries around the world - mainly those in the tropics. The tradition might be spreading to the UK as Giant Toasted Ants are already available at Selfridges for £14.99 a pack.

       "article_nosymbols       By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 12:19 EST, 8 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:05 EST, 8 March 2013 . Israel has been invaded by a swarm of more than one million locusts, sending the nation into panic that the country could be plagued by the insects over the forthcoming Passover holiday. However, local chefs welcome the insects as the grasshopper relatives are not only tasty, but also kosher. Said to taste like a mix between a sunflower seed and a baby shrimp, what may appear to be a plague, may in fact be the perfect Passover treat. Super swarm: More than one million locusts have crossed the border from Egypt to Israel . Crackdown: A man holds locusts as the swarm is tested on the Israeli border with Egypt . A swarm of an estimated 30 million . insects had been devastating crops in Egypt, putting authorities on high alert as sparrow sized locusts began making their way . into Israel earlier this week. Reports suggest that the insects are . mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been . reported elsewhere. Chef Moshe Bassoon who cooks locusts . in his Jerusalem restaurant says he counts himself 'lucky' to have been . able to get wild insects for his eatery. 'You want them plump and meaty,' he . told The Times, suggesting different ways of cooking the insects, . including rolling them in chickpea batter and frying them in oil until . they 'turn red   like a lobster.' Holiday food: Locusts are not only delicious, local Israeli chefs say, but also kosher and the perfect treat . Damaging: A swarms of locusts fly near Kadesh Barnea, in Jerusalem, Israel, yesterday after crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt . Mr Basson ensures the winged creatures are kosher, as he himself had to prove their status to a rabbi before he began serving them at his restaurant. 'I had to bring a male and a female and the eggs to the rabbi for his examination,' he said. 'And I had to prove that there was a local tradition of Jews eating them.' The . locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which begins on March 25. It . recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, during which, according . to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God . imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews . from slavery. Pharaoh did not agree to let them go until after the 10th . plague, the death of the first born in every Egyptian family. Delicacy: While many fear the effect they may have on crops, some chefs celebrate the locusts' arrival . Israel's Agriculture Ministry sent . out planes to spray pesticides over agricultural fields earlier in the . week to prevent damage by the locusts and set up an emergency hotline . and asked Israelis to report sightings. Miriam Freund, director of plant . protection in the Agriculture Ministry, called it a 'medium sized swarm' and her office set up a hotline for farmers to call in case they see it . advance. 'We hope our . actions are effective,' one of the pilots of a plane spraying the fields . said on Army Radio. 'Let's hope the damage will be minimal.' A bag of bugs please: A saleswoman and her wares of bamboo worms and other fried insects in northern Thailand . Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthal’s recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,’ says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat. In China beetles and roaches are sold as snacks at markets. More than 1,000 insects are eaten in 80 per cent of countries around the world   mainly those in the tropics. The tradition might be spreading to the UK as Giant Toasted Ants are already available at Selfridges for £14.99 a pack. Rene Redzepi, head chef at award winning Danish restaurant Noma, recently served ants at a £195 a head lunch at Claridge’s in London.\n",

State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month.

       "      <td>(CNN)   Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45 year old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K 9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.</td>\n",

The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort. Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota (pictured) is where the bishop is located .  \n",
       "1  (CNN)   Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45 year old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K 9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.  "

       "article                 By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 12:19 EST, 8 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:05 EST, 8 March 2013 . Israel has been invaded by a swarm of more than one million locusts, sending the nation into panic that the country could be plagued by the insects over the forthcoming Passover holiday. However, local chefs welcome the insects as the grasshopper-relatives are not only tasty, but also kosher. Said to taste like a mix between a sunflower seed and a baby shrimp, what may appear to be a plague, may in fact be the perfect Passover treat. Super swarm: More than one million locusts have crossed the border from Egypt to Israel . Crackdown: A man holds locusts as the swarm is tested on the Israeli border with Egypt . A swarm of an estimated 30 million . insects had been devastating crops in Egypt, putting authorities on high alert as sparrow-sized locusts began making their way . into Israel earlier this week. Reports suggest that the insects are . mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been . reported elsewhere. Chef Moshe Bassoon who cooks locusts . in his Jerusalem restaurant says he counts himself 'lucky' to have been . able to get wild insects for his eatery. 'You want them plump and meaty,' he . told The Times, suggesting different ways of cooking the insects, . including rolling them in chickpea batter and frying them in oil until . they 'turn red - like a lobster.' Holiday food: Locusts are not only delicious, local Israeli chefs say, but also kosher and the perfect treat . Damaging: A swarms of locusts fly near Kadesh Barnea, in Jerusalem, Israel, yesterday after crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt . Mr Basson ensures the winged creatures are kosher, as he himself had to prove their status to a rabbi before he began serving them at his restaurant. 'I had to bring a male and a female and the eggs to the rabbi for his examination,' he said. 'And I had to prove that there was a local tradition of Jews eating them.' The . locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which begins on March 25. It . recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, during which, according . to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God . imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews . from slavery. Pharaoh did not agree to let them go until after the 10th . plague, the death of the first born in every Egyptian family. Delicacy: While many fear the effect they may have on crops, some chefs celebrate the locusts' arrival . Israel's Agriculture Ministry sent . out planes to spray pesticides over agricultural fields earlier in the . week to prevent damage by the locusts and set up an emergency hotline . and asked Israelis to report sightings. Miriam Freund, director of plant . protection in the Agriculture Ministry, called it a 'medium-sized swarm' and her office set up a hotline for farmers to call in case they see it . advance. 'We hope our . actions are effective,' one of the pilots of a plane spraying the fields . said on Army Radio. 'Let's hope the damage will be minimal.' A bag of bugs please: A saleswoman and her wares of bamboo worms and other fried insects in northern Thailand . Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthal’s recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,’ says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat. In China beetles and roaches are sold as snacks at markets. More than 1,000 insects are eaten in 80 per cent of countries around the world - mainly those in the tropics. The tradition might be spreading to the UK as Giant Toasted Ants are already available at Selfridges for £14.99 a pack.

       "article_nosymbols       By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 12:19 EST, 8 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:05 EST, 8 March 2013 . Israel has been invaded by a swarm of more than one million locusts, sending the nation into panic that the country could be plagued by the insects over the forthcoming Passover holiday. However, local chefs welcome the insects as the grasshopper relatives are not only tasty, but also kosher. Said to taste like a mix between a sunflower seed and a baby shrimp, what may appear to be a plague, may in fact be the perfect Passover treat. Super swarm: More than one million locusts have crossed the border from Egypt to Israel . Crackdown: A man holds locusts as the swarm is tested on the Israeli border with Egypt . A swarm of an estimated 30 million . insects had been devastating crops in Egypt, putting authorities on high alert as sparrow sized locusts began making their way . into Israel earlier this week. Reports suggest that the insects are . mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been . reported elsewhere. Chef Moshe Bassoon who cooks locusts . in his Jerusalem restaurant says he counts himself 'lucky' to have been . able to get wild insects for his eatery. 'You want them plump and meaty,' he . told The Times, suggesting different ways of cooking the insects, . including rolling them in chickpea batter and frying them in oil until . they 'turn red   like a lobster.' Holiday food: Locusts are not only delicious, local Israeli chefs say, but also kosher and the perfect treat . Damaging: A swarms of locusts fly near Kadesh Barnea, in Jerusalem, Israel, yesterday after crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt . Mr Basson ensures the winged creatures are kosher, as he himself had to prove their status to a rabbi before he began serving them at his restaurant. 'I had to bring a male and a female and the eggs to the rabbi for his examination,' he said. 'And I had to prove that there was a local tradition of Jews eating them.' The . locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which begins on March 25. It . recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, during which, according . to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God . imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews . from slavery. Pharaoh did not agree to let them go until after the 10th . plague, the death of the first born in every Egyptian family. Delicacy: While many fear the effect they may have on crops, some chefs celebrate the locusts' arrival . Israel's Agriculture Ministry sent . out planes to spray pesticides over agricultural fields earlier in the . week to prevent damage by the locusts and set up an emergency hotline . and asked Israelis to report sightings. Miriam Freund, director of plant . protection in the Agriculture Ministry, called it a 'medium sized swarm' and her office set up a hotline for farmers to call in case they see it . advance. 'We hope our . actions are effective,' one of the pilots of a plane spraying the fields . said on Army Radio. 'Let's hope the damage will be minimal.' A bag of bugs please: A saleswoman and her wares of bamboo worms and other fried insects in northern Thailand . Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthal’s recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,’ says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat. In China beetles and roaches are sold as snacks at markets. More than 1,000 insects are eaten in 80 per cent of countries around the world   mainly those in the tropics.

       "article_nometa                                                                                                           Israel has been invaded by a swarm of more than one million locusts, sending the nation into panic that the country could be plagued by the insects over the forthcoming Passover holiday. However, local chefs welcome the insects as the grasshopper relatives are not only tasty, but also kosher. Said to taste like a mix between a sunflower seed and a baby shrimp, what may appear to be a plague, may in fact be the perfect Passover treat. Super swarm: More than one million locusts have crossed the border from Egypt to Israel . Crackdown: A man holds locusts as the swarm is tested on the Israeli border with Egypt . A swarm of an estimated 30 million . insects had been devastating crops in Egypt, putting authorities on high alert as sparrow sized locusts began making their way . into Israel earlier this week. Reports suggest that the insects are . mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been . reported elsewhere. Chef Moshe Bassoon who cooks locusts . in his Jerusalem restaurant says he counts himself 'lucky' to have been . able to get wild insects for his eatery. 'You want them plump and meaty,' he . told The Times, suggesting different ways of cooking the insects, . including rolling them in chickpea batter and frying them in oil until . they 'turn red   like a lobster.' Holiday food: Locusts are not only delicious, local Israeli chefs say, but also kosher and the perfect treat . Damaging: A swarms of locusts fly near Kadesh Barnea, in Jerusalem, Israel, yesterday after crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt . Mr Basson ensures the winged creatures are kosher, as he himself had to prove their status to a rabbi before he began serving them at his restaurant. 'I had to bring a male and a female and the eggs to the rabbi for his examination,' he said. 'And I had to prove that there was a local tradition of Jews eating them.' The . locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which begins on March 25. It . recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, during which, according . to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God . imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews . from slavery. Pharaoh did not agree to let them go until after the 10th . plague, the death of the first born in every Egyptian family. Delicacy: While many fear the effect they may have on crops, some chefs celebrate the locusts' arrival . Israel's Agriculture Ministry sent . out planes to spray pesticides over agricultural fields earlier in the . week to prevent damage by the locusts and set up an emergency hotline . and asked Israelis to report sightings. Miriam Freund, director of plant . protection in the Agriculture Ministry, called it a 'medium sized swarm' and her office set up a hotline for farmers to call in case they see it . advance. 'We hope our . actions are effective,' one of the pilots of a plane spraying the fields . said on Army Radio. 'Let's hope the damage will be minimal.' A bag of bugs please: A saleswoman and her wares of bamboo worms and other fried insects in northern Thailand . Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthal’s recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,’ says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat. In China beetles and roaches are sold as snacks at markets. More than 1,000 insects are eaten in 80 per cent of countries around the world   mainly those in the tropics.

The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month.

       "      <td>Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45 year old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the   decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K 9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A drunk driver who killed a young woman in a head on crash while checking his mobile phone has been jailed for six years. Craig Eccleston Todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into Rachel Titley’s car coming the other way. Craig Eccleston Todd, 27   was using his mobile phone when he crashed head on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28  . She died later from her injuries . The head on crash took place in October 2013. Mr Eccleston Todd's car was barely recognisable   Police said Eccleston Todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Miss Titley, a 28 year old solicitor’s clerk from Cowes, Isle of Wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. She was driving responsibly and there was ‘nothing she could have done to avoid the collision’, they added. Lindsay Pennell, prosecuting, said: ‘Craig Eccleston Todd’s driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, Rachel Titley, a death that could have been avoided. ‘Mr Eccleston Todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of Miss Titley’s oncoming car. Miss Titley was pulled the wreckage of her Daihatsu Cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . ‘Miss Titley   a bright future ahead of her. She was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. ‘She had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. Her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. ‘Miss Titley’s death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand held mobile phone whilst driving.’ Police were unable to take breath or blood tests from Eccleston Todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink drive limit. The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titley’s blue Daihatsu Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013. His phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. PC Mark Furse, from Hampshire constabulary’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'Our thoughts are with Rachel's family at this time. She had been out with friends at a pub in Shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. 'Our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. 'Mr Eccleston Todd had left work in Yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. He hadn't long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. 'We weren't able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. 'The analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so it's highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.' Eccleston Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court   He added: 'Mr Eccleston Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel's family have lost her forever. 'I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they're on the road. 'The dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.' ‘Mr Eccleston Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel’s family have lost her for ever. I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they’re on the road. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.’ Eccleston Todd, of Newport, Isle of Wight, was also disqualified from driving for eight years after which he will have to complete an extended re test.</td>\n",

       "      <td>With a breezy sweep of his pen President Vladimir Putin wrote a new chapter into Crimea's turbulent history, committing the region to a future returned to Russian domain. Sixty years prior, Ukraine's breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. But dealing with such a blatant land grab on its eastern flank won't be anywhere near as quick and easy for Europe's 28 member union. Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say. After initially slapping visa restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little known politicians and military men, Europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the Russian business community in particular. The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. Alexei Navalny, one time Moscow mayoral contender now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called for Europe's leaders to ban everyone   from Vladimir Putin's personal banker to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. Asset freezes and visa restrictions are especially palatable options for the EU because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. In fact Russia cancels visas for people it doesn't like all the time. Just look at Hermitage Capital founder Bill Browder who lost both his right of entry and Moscow based money in 2005 and dare not go back. Russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by Americans in retaliation for the US's implementation of an anti corruption law named after Sergei Magnitsky, Browder's lawyer who died after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Yet in playing the 'money talks' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. Because money also walks. As such EU leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two way street and will hurt both sides. Targeting Russia's peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for President Putin. And such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining: awarding EU countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money laundering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like London property and Picasso paintings for years. Where Europe should hold fire though is trade. Two decades of post Soviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake. It's true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the EU   not least because 15% of the former's GDP comes from exports to the bloc. But Europe   with its hefty reliance on Russian gas   would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. And while Putin flexes his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. No one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the wane.</td>\n",

In the lead: Jose Baxter   celebrates opening the scoring for Sheffield United . Up for the battle: Sheffield United's Michael Doyle   challenges Peterborough's Kyle Vassell in a keenly contested clash . Bristol City, who beat Nigel Clough’s men on the opening day, were held to a goalless draw by last season's play off finalists Leyton Orient while Chesterfield, the League Two champions, were beaten 1 0 by MK Dons, who play Manchester United in the Capital One Cup in seven days’ time. Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe scored the only goal of the game just after the break. Meanwhile, Crawley lost their unbeaten status, while Bradford maintained theirs, thanks to a 3 1 win for the Bantams. James Hanson became the first player to score against Crawley this season after 49 minutes before Joe Walsh equalised five minutes later. Heads up: Bristol City's Korey Smith   and Leyton Orient's Lloyd James go up for a header . But strikes from Billy Knott and Mason Bennett sealed an impressive away win Phil Parkinson's men. Bradford are now second behind Fleetwood after Doncaster’s stoppage time equaliser meant Preston, for whom Joe Garner signed a new contract earlier on Tuesday, were held to a 1 1 draw which slipped them down the table. Chris Humphrey looked to have secured the points for the Lilywhites but Nathan Tyson struck a last gasp leveller. Stand in striker Matt Done scored a hat trick for Rochdale in the evening’s high scoring affair as Crewe were hammered 5 2. Marcus Haber marked his full Railwaymen debut with a brace but Done’s treble and goals from Ian Henderson and Peter Vincenti helped Keith Hill’s men to a big away victory. There were plenty of goals between Coventry and Barnsley too in a 2 2 draw with all four goals coming in the first half. Josh McQuoid and Jordan Clarke twice gave the Sky Blues the lead, but the Tykes earned a point thanks to strikes from Conor Hourihane and Leroy Lita. Notts County recorded a 2 1 home win over Colchester with Ronan Murray and Liam Noble on target. Freddie Sears replied for Colchester. James Wilson's second half equaliser earned Oldham a points against Port Vale after Tom Pope's opener and Yeovil claimed a 2 1 away victory at Walsall with Kevin Dawson striking a late winner. Tom Bradshaw had equalised after veteran James Hayter gave the Glovers the lead. Finally, Swindon held Gillingham to a 2 2 draw thanks to Stephen Bywater’s last minute own goal. Danny Kedwell and Kortney Hause twice gave the Gills the lead but Andy Williams pulled Swindon level before Bywater dropped Raphael Branco's cross into his own net.</td>\n",

       "      <td>By . James Rush . Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has indicated she could one day be open to running for office. The only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton has said she is no longer able to completely rule out the possibility of making a political bid if, at some point, she did not support her local representatives. The 34 year old suggested she may be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator. Scroll down for video . Future bid: Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has said she may one day consider running for office . Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her father, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, suggested she may one day be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator . In an interview, Clinton told Fast Company how ever since being a child she had always been asked about going into politics, with the answer usually being a plain 'no'. But now, she said, the answer was not so clear. She said: 'I live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected representatives. 'If at some point that weren't the case, and I didn't support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congressman or either of my senators   and I'm lucky to live in a state where I have lots of women representing me, you know   maybe then I'd have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different answer.' It is not the first time Clinton, currently vice chair of the recently rebranded Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, has spoken in these terms   she has previously given a similar response to Marlo Thomas, as published on The Huffington Post. And after delivering a keynote speech at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas last month, she said she was slowly changing her mind about whether to run for office herself in coming years, according to Buzzfeed. Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her mother, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has said she cannot completely rule out ever running for office . 'I donâ€™t know,' she said. 'For a long time, my answer to that question was no. 'At the moment I find it pretty discouraging that almost none of my friends think about running for public office as an option.' Last month, MailOnline reported on how Clinton told the tech conference what it was like growing up in one of America's most famous and powerful families   and how she learned to debate with them on major issues from the age of six. And while her father may have been the leader of the free world and her mother the U.S. Secretary of State, criss crossing the globe solving international crises, they both needed their daughter's help to learn how to text. 'I definitely taught my parents how to text and how to charge their phones,' Chelsea Clinton said, adding the latter was 'a very mysterious thing' for her parents. Of the mock debates the family would have at home in Arkansas, she told how she would argue with one of her parents and the other would act as moderator.</td>\n",

The rapper turned renovation show reality star   charged with burglary and grand theft after allegedly pilfering property from a foreclosed home in Palm Beach,  Florida   seemed teary as he said he has barely eaten or slept since turning himself into police on Wednesday. 'I'm a family man, I've got kids, I'm sorry to everybody for whatever this is,' Van Winkle told WPBP News as he left Florida for Columbus, Ohio, on Friday. 'I really love the community, where I live here in Palm Beach, I do a lot of things... hopefully people can see who I am, the real me.' Scroll down for video . 'I'm sorry to everybody': Vanilla Ice gave his first proper interview since being released from lock up earlier this week while leaving Florida on Friday bound for Columbus Ohio. He was teary, apologetic and upset . 'Worst day': The 47 year old maintains he was trying to purchase the home that the property   left behind furniture   was stolen from, after it went into foreclosure . Van Winkle has told investigators he was 'going to purchase' the home that the stolen property was removed from. He is accused of breaking into a vacant home and stolen furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items. 'I'm still actively trying to by this house,' he told the network. 'It's just sad the way this has played out. It's not me.' 'I feel horrible. It's the worst day of my life.' The burglarized residence, which is in foreclosure, is near a home that Van Winkle was working on for his show on DIY Network, The Vanilla Ice Project, and some of the stolen property was later found at Van Winkle's personal home, police say. It has been reported however that Van Winkle told his work crew that he owned the home, and sent them over twice to burgle the property. Vanilla Ice, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was  charged with burglary of a residence and grand theft . Police say Van Winkle stole items from this house in Lantana, Florida, while he was filming his reality show inside an adjacent home . Van Winkle   was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond . According to the New York Daily News; 'Cops later interviewed Ice's construction foreman, who said Ice told him he'd bought the property and ordered him to fetch stuff from it, including the pool heater and two bikes, worth about $400.In the show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip houses.' Then, earlier this month, a mirrored coffee table and some glass knick knacks were reported missing from the property. The real estate broker of the burglarized $1million home, Jim Lovely, called the situation a 'hassle', according to NBC Miami. Lovely said: 'Why would you jeopardize going to jail for basically junk? 'It was just worthless furniture and some items so it doesn't make much sense. 'The house wasn't full of Picassos, so it wasn't a high dollar heist.' The former pop star, who rose to fame with the 1990s hit 'Ice Ice Baby,' was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond, according to WPBF. Van Winkle called the situation a 'misunderstanding' that 'was blown out of proportion'. He said: 'It's sad that good news doesn't travel this fast. 'It's just out of proportion and I wish you guys would focus on all the good things I've done. 'It'll all get cleared up, you'll see.' Authorities believe Van Winkle stole furniture, a pool heater  , bicycles and other items . The broker for the property said the house, which did contain some furniture  , 'wasn't full of Picassos' Police took Van Winkle into custody after they obtained a search warrant and recovered some of the stolen items at his home in Palm Beach County. The Lantana Police Department said: 'During the investigation, it was determined Robert Matthew Van Winkle played a role in the burglary and theft. 'A search warrant was obtained and executed in unincorporated Palm Beach County in which several of the stolen items were recovered at a residence under the care and control of Robert Van Winkle.' The items have been returned to their owner. In his DIY Network show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip homes. DIY is 'aware' of the situation . The items which Van Winkle allegedly took from the home   have been returned to their owner .

He said: 'I wish it was. There's nothing fun about this. 'I wish everybody all the best, and maybe some of the good news will travel this fast in the future.' DIY Network is 'aware' of the situation and 'looking into the matter'. The cable star is still scheduled to appear at the Columbus Dispatch Home and Garden Show on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio. Tommy Quon of TQ Management Agency told the Columbus Dispatch that Van Winkle will be speaking about home renovation. He said: 'Rob will be available to make the home show in Columbus. 'I still don't know what exactly happened but will get all the facts together and decide a course of action.' Van Winkle has been married to wife Laura since 1997 and they have two daughters together. This is not his first brush with the law; in 1991, he was arrested and pleaded no contest for threatening a homeless man with a gun. A decade later, he was arrested by Florida police and spent a night in jail for assaulting his wife as they argued while driving. He admitted that he had pulled her hair, but said it was to stop her from jumping out of their truck, and was sentenced to probation and attended family therapy sessions. In 2008, Van Winkle was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife again   but was released the following day after she said he had only pushed her. The case was dropped two weeks later.</td>\n",

       "      <td>America's most lethal sniper claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis despite accumulating 160 confirmed kills   with the true number estimated to be as high as 255. Speaking just months before his untimely death, Chris Kyle insisted his only regret was that US lives were lost because he shot too few of the enemy. The late veteran's wartime exploits are portrayed in the divisive Oscar tipped movie American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood. Little regrets: In an interview three years ago America's most lethal sniper Chris Kyle claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis . Speaking to Toby Harnden of The Sunday Times three years ago, Kyle was asked whether he regretted any of his kills while on tour. Replying in his characteristically soft Texan drawl, the former sniper, said: 'No, sir, not at all. 'To be honest with you, I wish I'd killed more because every kill saved American lives and that was what I was out there for.' Kyle was thrilled by the success of his autobiographical book, which led to 'huge fascination' with the grisly art of snipers. The soldier, played by Bradley Cooper in Oscar tipped film American Sniper  , accumulated 160 confirmed kills in Iraq, with the true number estimated to be as high as 255 . In the 2012 interview, he added: 'It's been a taboo for too long, I'm glad that people are actually looking at it with an interest and saying these guys are actually something we need.' Less than a year after the conversation, Kyle was killed on a remote shooting range in Texas by a disturbed veteran he was helping, who was said to have been suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  . Opinion: Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper . The movie based on Kyle's book, produced by and starring Bradley Cooper, has been a box office hit, but has also divided opinion, with some criticising the film's jingoistic stance. Filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II. Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Seth Rogen also caused controversy after tweeting: 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds.' The comedy actor faced a storm of online abuse for his comment and recently issued a clarification and apology. He wrote: ‘It appears I need to further clarify a tweet I sent a few days ago. 'I said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie. 'I didn't compare the two at all. I merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other, because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers. ‘People then claimed that I compared the movie American Sniper to Nazi propaganda, something I would never do. 'I'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone, but that was not my intention. I hope this clears things up.’ Critics of the movie included talk show host Bill Maher, who claimed the film is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero. Controversy: Rogen said American Sniper   reminded him of Nation's Pride  , a fake Nazi propaganda film from Quentin Tarantino's World War II film Inglorious Basterds . Speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, he drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'. Kid Rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by Rogen and Moore, tweeting: ‘: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.' 'Psychopath patriot   and we love him': Talk show host Bill Maher was uncompromising in his criticism of Kyle   and seized . Oscar tipped: Clint Eastwood's   movie is hotly tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper   He chose parts of the book, also called American Sniper, where Kyle said 'I love killing bad guys   even with the pain I loved what I was doing.' The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise. Maher said: 'Hurt Locker' made $17million because it was a little ambiguous and thoughtful...   is just \"American hero! He's a psychopath patriot, and we love him.\"' American Sniper has earned six Oscar nominations, including Best Actor for Bradley Cooper.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Israel has been invaded by a swarm of more than one million locusts, sending the nation into panic that the country could be plagued by the insects over the forthcoming Passover holiday. However, local chefs welcome the insects as the grasshopper relatives are not only tasty, but also kosher. Said to taste like a mix between a sunflower seed and a baby shrimp, what may appear to be a plague, may in fact be the perfect Passover treat. Super swarm: More than one million locusts have crossed the border from Egypt to Israel . Crackdown: A man holds locusts as the swarm is tested on the Israeli border with Egypt . A swarm of an estimated 30 million . insects had been devastating crops in Egypt, putting authorities on high alert as sparrow sized locusts began making their way . into Israel earlier this week. Reports suggest that the insects are . mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been . reported elsewhere. Chef Moshe Bassoon who cooks locusts . in his Jerusalem restaurant says he counts himself 'lucky' to have been . able to get wild insects for his eatery. 'You want them plump and meaty,' he . told The Times, suggesting different ways of cooking the insects, . including rolling them in chickpea batter and frying them in oil until . they 'turn red   like a lobster.' Holiday food: Locusts are not only delicious, local Israeli chefs say, but also kosher and the perfect treat . Damaging: A swarms of locusts fly near Kadesh Barnea, in Jerusalem, Israel, yesterday after crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt . Mr Basson ensures the winged creatures are kosher, as he himself had to prove their status to a rabbi before he began serving them at his restaurant. 'I had to bring a male and a female and the eggs to the rabbi for his examination,' he said. 'And I had to prove that there was a local tradition of Jews eating them.' The . locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which begins on March 25. It . recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, during which, according . to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God . imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews . from slavery. Pharaoh did not agree to let them go until after the 10th . plague, the death of the first born in every Egyptian family. Delicacy: While many fear the effect they may have on crops, some chefs celebrate the locusts' arrival . Israel's Agriculture Ministry sent . out planes to spray pesticides over agricultural fields earlier in the . week to prevent damage by the locusts and set up an emergency hotline . and asked Israelis to report sightings. Miriam Freund, director of plant . protection in the Agriculture Ministry, called it a 'medium sized swarm' and her office set up a hotline for farmers to call in case they see it . advance. 'We hope our . actions are effective,' one of the pilots of a plane spraying the fields . said on Army Radio. 'Let's hope the damage will be minimal.' A bag of bugs please: A saleswoman and her wares of bamboo worms and other fried insects in northern Thailand . Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthal’s recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,’ says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat. In China beetles and roaches are sold as snacks at markets. More than 1,000 insects are eaten in 80 per cent of countries around the world   mainly those in the tropics. The tradition might be spreading to the UK as Giant Toasted Ants are already available at Selfridges for £14.99 a pack. Rene Redzepi, head chef at award winning Danish restaurant Noma, recently served ants at a £195 a head lunch at Claridge’s in London.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Other 2016 hopefuls maintain that Bush's announcement wouldn't prevent them from running  Bush posted Tuesday on his social media accounts that he's exploring a presidential bid  Bush has been making moves toward a run   particularly in the past 48 hours  Democrats said that Bush's announcement was more about keeping his name in the news .</td>\n",
       "      <td>Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has decided to \"actively explore\" a presidential bid after conversations with his family over Thanksgiving, he said in a Facebook post Tuesday. While Bush had been making steps toward a presidential bid with recent speeches in early primary states and plans to release documents from his time period as governor, the timing of Tuesday's announcement was widely unexpected and will quicken the pace for some would be Republican primary challengers. In the post, Bush writes that over the holiday he \"talked about the future of the nation\" with his family. \"As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States,\" he said. Bush has been moving toward a run for months and in recent days sparked renewed speculation over his plans with a visit to the all important early primary state of South Carolina to give a commencement speech Monday, and his comments in a Sunday interview that he felt he \"would be a good president.\" RELATED: Bush to grads: 'Shake things up' Democrats scoffed at his announcement. Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee suggested it was simply meant to draw press, but dismissed the possibility of a Bush run either way. \"I don't know what the difference is between 'thinking about' running and 'actively exploring' running, but I suspect it has a lot to do with keeping his name in the news,\" Elleithee said. \"However you see it, there's no parsing this simple fact: Jeb Bush has fully embraced the failed economic agenda that benefits only a select few at the expense of the middle class. That's not going to change no matter how many different ways he says he may run.\" Bush's announcement is sure to speed up the timeline for many other potential Republican presidential contenders on whether to jump in as well. Bush is seen as a top pick for establishment Republicans hoping to encourage the party to nominate a candidate they see as most electable on the national stage. Many observers believe if Bush jumps in the race, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — who's been mentored by Bush since his entry into Florida politics — wouldn't run. And he'd likely make it tougher for some of the more establishment minded governors, like Texas Gov. Rick Perry or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, to find footing in the race. However, a source near Rubio said Tuesday that while Bush's announcement changes the dynamic of the race, the junior Florida Senator is still \"on track to run for president\" in 2016. And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has been actively preparing for a bid and would likely run to Bush's right flank, also seemed nonplussed by the announcement. \"I think we're a big tent   we can use moderates, conservatives, libertarians — we need em all,\" he told reporters walking into the Capitol. Asked whether he could win the nomination, Paul demurred. \"I think the more the merrier   the public will determine that.\" Bush added in Tuesday's post that he hopes \"to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of America\" in the coming months. RELATED: 6 things to know about Jeb Bush . Bush also announced the creation of a PAC, which will aim to \"support leaders, ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans.\" He added that the PAC would \"facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation.\" On Sunday, Bush also announced plans to release about 250,000 emails from his time in office and an upcoming e book about his time as governor, moves seen as efforts to re introduce Americans to his governing chops in preparation to emerge as a more prominent player on the national stage. If he does make his bid official, he'll likely face fierce opposition from conservatives in the primary, who have long been frustrated with his advocacy for Common Core educational standards and his support for a more moderate vision of immigration reform. RELATED: Bush releases 250,000 emails . He's previously expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, though he's wavered in that support since. And while he's come out in opposition to President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, he's also urged Republicans to act on immigration reform \"rather than have their heads explode.\" That moderation on immigration reform — and his diverse family, as his wife was born in Mexico and he speaks fluent Spanish — have many in the GOP hopeful Bush could help the party overcome some of their deficit with Hispanic voters, which has proven to be problematic for them in national races. Despite the likely conservative opposition, Bush has hinted he wouldn't shift to the far right to please GOP primary voters if he runs. During the Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting earlier this month, Bush warned that the GOP presidential nominee shouldn't \"lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles.\" The comments came as the conservative and more centrist wings of the GOP continue to debate a path forward for the party, with many on the right arguing former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost in 2012 because he didn't stand strong enough on conservative principles. But Romney and Bush, despite the conservative criticism, remain two of the most popular figures in the party, and indeed both led the recent McClatchy Marist national poll of the potential GOP presidential field. Romney took 19 percent, while Bush came in second with 14 percent support; with Romney out of the race, Bush would lead with 16 percent support, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 12 percent. Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.</td>\n",

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45 year old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the   decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K 9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.  \n",

Craig Eccleston Todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into Rachel Titley’s car coming the other way. Craig Eccleston Todd, 27   was using his mobile phone when he crashed head on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28  . She died later from her injuries . The head on crash took place in October 2013. Mr Eccleston Todd's car was barely recognisable   Police said Eccleston Todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Miss Titley, a 28 year old solicitor’s clerk from Cowes, Isle of Wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. She was driving responsibly and there was ‘nothing she could have done to avoid the collision’, they added. Lindsay Pennell, prosecuting, said: ‘Craig Eccleston Todd’s driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, Rachel Titley, a death that could have been avoided. ‘Mr Eccleston Todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of Miss Titley’s oncoming car. Miss Titley was pulled the wreckage of her Daihatsu Cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . ‘Miss Titley   a bright future ahead of her. She was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. ‘She had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. Her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. ‘Miss Titley’s death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand held mobile phone whilst driving.’ Police were unable to take breath or blood tests from Eccleston Todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink drive limit. The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titley’s blue Daihatsu Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013. His phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. PC Mark Furse, from Hampshire constabulary’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'Our thoughts are with Rachel's family at this time. She had been out with friends at a pub in Shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. 'Our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. 'Mr Eccleston Todd had left work in Yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. He hadn't long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. 'We weren't able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. 'The analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so it's highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.' Eccleston Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court   He added: 'Mr Eccleston Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel's family have lost her forever. 'I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they're on the road. 'The dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.' ‘Mr Eccleston Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel’s family have lost her for ever. I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they’re on the road. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.’ Eccleston Todd, of Newport, Isle of Wight, was also disqualified from driving for eight years after which he will have to complete an extended re test.  \n",

Sixty years prior, Ukraine's breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. But dealing with such a blatant land grab on its eastern flank won't be anywhere near as quick and easy for Europe's 28 member union. Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say. After initially slapping visa restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little known politicians and military men, Europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the Russian business community in particular. The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. Alexei Navalny, one time Moscow mayoral contender now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called for Europe's leaders to ban everyone   from Vladimir Putin's personal banker to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. Asset freezes and visa restrictions are especially palatable options for the EU because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. In fact Russia cancels visas for people it doesn't like all the time. Just look at Hermitage Capital founder Bill Browder who lost both his right of entry and Moscow based money in 2005 and dare not go back. Russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by Americans in retaliation for the US's implementation of an anti corruption law named after Sergei Magnitsky, Browder's lawyer who died after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Yet in playing the 'money talks' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. Because money also walks. As such EU leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two way street and will hurt both sides. Targeting Russia's peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for President Putin. And such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining: awarding EU countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money laundering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like London property and Picasso paintings for years. Where Europe should hold fire though is trade. Two decades of post Soviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake. It's true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the EU   not least because 15% of the former's GDP comes from exports to the bloc. But Europe   with its hefty reliance on Russian gas   would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. And while Putin flexes his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. No one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the wane.  \n",

The Cod Army are playing in the third tier for the first time in their history after six promotions in nine years and their remarkable ascent shows no sign of slowing with Jamie Proctor and Gareth Evans scoring the goals at Glanford Park. Fleetwood were one of five teams to have won two out of two but the other four clubs   Peterborough, Bristol City, Chesterfield and Crawley   all hit their first stumbling blocks. Posh were defeated 2 1 by Sheffield United, who had lost both of their opening contests. Jose Baxter’s opener gave the Blades a first half lead, and although it was later cancelled out by Shaun Brisley’s goal, Ben Davies snatched a winner six minutes from time. In the lead: Jose Baxter   celebrates opening the scoring for Sheffield United . Up for the battle: Sheffield United's Michael Doyle   challenges Peterborough's Kyle Vassell in a keenly contested clash . Bristol City, who beat Nigel Clough’s men on the opening day, were held to a goalless draw by last season's play off finalists Leyton Orient while Chesterfield, the League Two champions, were beaten 1 0 by MK Dons, who play Manchester United in the Capital One Cup in seven days’ time. Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe scored the only goal of the game just after the break. Meanwhile, Crawley lost their unbeaten status, while Bradford maintained theirs, thanks to a 3 1 win for the Bantams. James Hanson became the first player to score against Crawley this season after 49 minutes before Joe Walsh equalised five minutes later. Heads up: Bristol City's Korey Smith   and Leyton Orient's Lloyd James go up for a header . But strikes from Billy Knott and Mason Bennett sealed an impressive away win Phil Parkinson's men. Bradford are now second behind Fleetwood after Doncaster’s stoppage time equaliser meant Preston, for whom Joe Garner signed a new contract earlier on Tuesday, were held to a 1 1 draw which slipped them down the table. Chris Humphrey looked to have secured the points for the Lilywhites but Nathan Tyson struck a last gasp leveller. Stand in striker Matt Done scored a hat trick for Rochdale in the evening’s high scoring affair as Crewe were hammered 5 2. Marcus Haber marked his full Railwaymen debut with a brace but Done’s treble and goals from Ian Henderson and Peter Vincenti helped Keith Hill’s men to a big away victory. There were plenty of goals between Coventry and Barnsley too in a 2 2 draw with all four goals coming in the first half. Josh McQuoid and Jordan Clarke twice gave the Sky Blues the lead, but the Tykes earned a point thanks to strikes from Conor Hourihane and Leroy Lita. Notts County recorded a 2 1 home win over Colchester with Ronan Murray and Liam Noble on target. Freddie Sears replied for Colchester. James Wilson's second half equaliser earned Oldham a points against Port Vale after Tom Pope's opener and Yeovil claimed a 2 1 away victory at Walsall with Kevin Dawson striking a late winner. Tom Bradshaw had equalised after veteran James Hayter gave the Glovers the lead. Finally, Swindon held Gillingham to a 2 2 draw thanks to Stephen Bywater’s last minute own goal. Danny Kedwell and Kortney Hause twice gave the Gills the lead but Andy Williams pulled Swindon level before Bywater dropped Raphael Branco's cross into his own net.  \n",

The only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton has said she is no longer able to completely rule out the possibility of making a political bid if, at some point, she did not support her local representatives. The 34 year old suggested she may be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator. Scroll down for video . Future bid: Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has said she may one day consider running for office . Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her father, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, suggested she may one day be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator . In an interview, Clinton told Fast Company how ever since being a child she had always been asked about going into politics, with the answer usually being a plain 'no'. But now, she said, the answer was not so clear. She said: 'I live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected representatives. 'If at some point that weren't the case, and I didn't support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congressman or either of my senators   and I'm lucky to live in a state where I have lots of women representing me, you know   maybe then I'd have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different answer.' It is not the first time Clinton, currently vice chair of the recently rebranded Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, has spoken in these terms   she has previously given a similar response to Marlo Thomas, as published on The Huffington Post. And after delivering a keynote speech at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas last month, she said she was slowly changing her mind about whether to run for office herself in coming years, according to Buzzfeed. Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her mother, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has said she cannot completely rule out ever running for office . 'I donâ€™t know,' she said. 'For a long time, my answer to that question was no. 'At the moment I find it pretty discouraging that almost none of my friends think about running for public office as an option.' Last month, MailOnline reported on how Clinton told the tech conference what it was like growing up in one of America's most famous and powerful families   and how she learned to debate with them on major issues from the age of six. And while her father may have been the leader of the free world and her mother the U.S. Secretary of State, criss crossing the globe solving international crises, they both needed their daughter's help to learn how to text. 'I definitely taught my parents how to text and how to charge their phones,' Chelsea Clinton said, adding the latter was 'a very mysterious thing' for her parents. Of the mock debates the family would have at home in Arkansas, she told how she would argue with one of her parents and the other would act as moderator.  \n",

Speaking just months before his untimely death, Chris Kyle insisted his only regret was that US lives were lost because he shot too few of the enemy. The late veteran's wartime exploits are portrayed in the divisive Oscar tipped movie American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood. Little regrets: In an interview three years ago America's most lethal sniper Chris Kyle claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis . Speaking to Toby Harnden of The Sunday Times three years ago, Kyle was asked whether he regretted any of his kills while on tour. Replying in his characteristically soft Texan drawl, the former sniper, said: 'No, sir, not at all. 'To be honest with you, I wish I'd killed more because every kill saved American lives and that was what I was out there for.' Kyle was thrilled by the success of his autobiographical book, which led to 'huge fascination' with the grisly art of snipers. The soldier, played by Bradley Cooper in Oscar tipped film American Sniper  , accumulated 160 confirmed kills in Iraq, with the true number estimated to be as high as 255 . In the 2012 interview, he added: 'It's been a taboo for too long, I'm glad that people are actually looking at it with an interest and saying these guys are actually something we need.' Less than a year after the conversation, Kyle was killed on a remote shooting range in Texas by a disturbed veteran he was helping, who was said to have been suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  . Opinion: Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper . The movie based on Kyle's book, produced by and starring Bradley Cooper, has been a box office hit, but has also divided opinion, with some criticising the film's jingoistic stance. Filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II. Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Seth Rogen also caused controversy after tweeting: 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds.' The comedy actor faced a storm of online abuse for his comment and recently issued a clarification and apology. He wrote: ‘It appears I need to further clarify a tweet I sent a few days ago. 'I said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie. 'I didn't compare the two at all. I merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other, because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers. ‘People then claimed that I compared the movie American Sniper to Nazi propaganda, something I would never do. 'I'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone, but that was not my intention. I hope this clears things up.’ Critics of the movie included talk show host Bill Maher, who claimed the film is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero. Controversy: Rogen said American Sniper   reminded him of Nation's Pride  , a fake Nazi propaganda film from Quentin Tarantino's World War II film Inglorious Basterds . Speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, he drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'. Kid Rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by Rogen and Moore, tweeting: ‘: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.' 'Psychopath patriot   and we love him': Talk show host Bill Maher was uncompromising in his criticism of Kyle   and seized . Oscar tipped: Clint Eastwood's   movie is hotly tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper   He chose parts of the book, also called American Sniper, where Kyle said 'I love killing bad guys   even with the pain I loved what I was doing.' The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise.

However, local chefs welcome the insects as the grasshopper relatives are not only tasty, but also kosher.

A bag of bugs please: A saleswoman and her wares of bamboo worms and other fried insects in northern Thailand . Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthal’s recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,’ says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat. In China beetles and roaches are sold as snacks at markets. More than 1,000 insects are eaten in 80 per cent of countries around the world   mainly those in the tropics. The tradition might be spreading to the UK as Giant Toasted Ants are already available at Selfridges for £14.99 a pack. Rene Redzepi, head chef at award winning Danish restaurant Noma, recently served ants at a £195 a head lunch at Claridge’s in London.  \n",
       "287112                                                             Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has decided to \"actively explore\" a presidential bid after conversations with his family over Thanksgiving, he said in a Facebook post Tuesday. While Bush had been making steps toward a presidential bid with recent speeches in early primary states and plans to release documents from his time period as governor, the timing of Tuesday's announcement was widely unexpected and will quicken the pace for some would be Republican primary challengers. In the post, Bush writes that over the holiday he \"talked about the future of the nation\" with his family. \"As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States,\" he said. Bush has been moving toward a run for months and in recent days sparked renewed speculation over his plans with a visit to the all important early primary state of South Carolina to give a commencement speech Monday, and his comments in a Sunday interview that he felt he \"would be a good president.\" RELATED: Bush to grads: 'Shake things up' Democrats scoffed at his announcement. Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee suggested it was simply meant to draw press, but dismissed the possibility of a Bush run either way. \"I don't know what the difference is between 'thinking about' running and 'actively exploring' running, but I suspect it has a lot to do with keeping his name in the news,\" Elleithee said. \"However you see it, there's no parsing this simple fact: Jeb Bush has fully embraced the failed economic agenda that benefits only a select few at the expense of the middle class. That's not going to change no matter how many different ways he says he may run.\" Bush's announcement is sure to speed up the timeline for many other potential Republican presidential contenders on whether to jump in as well. Bush is seen as a top pick for establishment Republicans hoping to encourage the party to nominate a candidate they see as most electable on the national stage. Many observers believe if Bush jumps in the race, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — who's been mentored by Bush since his entry into Florida politics — wouldn't run. And he'd likely make it tougher for some of the more establishment minded governors, like Texas Gov. Rick Perry or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, to find footing in the race. However, a source near Rubio said Tuesday that while Bush's announcement changes the dynamic of the race, the junior Florida Senator is still \"on track to run for president\" in 2016. And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has been actively preparing for a bid and would likely run to Bush's right flank, also seemed nonplussed by the announcement. \"I think we're a big tent   we can use moderates, conservatives, libertarians — we need em all,\" he told reporters walking into the Capitol. Asked whether he could win the nomination, Paul demurred. \"I think the more the merrier   the public will determine that.\" Bush added in Tuesday's post that he hopes \"to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of America\" in the coming months. RELATED: 6 things to know about Jeb Bush . Bush also announced the creation of a PAC, which will aim to \"support leaders, ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans.\" He added that the PAC would \"facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation.\" On Sunday, Bush also announced plans to release about 250,000 emails from his time in office and an upcoming e book about his time as governor, moves seen as efforts to re introduce Americans to his governing chops in preparation to emerge as a more prominent player on the national stage. If he does make his bid official, he'll likely face fierce opposition from conservatives in the primary, who have long been frustrated with his advocacy for Common Core educational standards and his support for a more moderate vision of immigration reform. RELATED: Bush releases 250,000 emails . He's previously expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, though he's wavered in that support since. And while he's come out in opposition to President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, he's also urged Republicans to act on immigration reform \"rather than have their heads explode.\" That moderation on immigration reform — and his diverse family, as his wife was born in Mexico and he speaks fluent Spanish — have many in the GOP hopeful Bush could help the party overcome some of their deficit with Hispanic voters, which has proven to be problematic for them in national races. Despite the likely conservative opposition, Bush has hinted he wouldn't shift to the far right to please GOP primary voters if he runs. During the Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting earlier this month, Bush warned that the GOP presidential nominee shouldn't \"lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles.\" The comments came as the conservative and more centrist wings of the GOP continue to debate a path forward for the party, with many on the right arguing former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost in 2012 because he didn't stand strong enough on conservative principles. But Romney and Bush, despite the conservative criticism, remain two of the most popular figures in the party, and indeed both led the recent McClatchy Marist national poll of the potential GOP presidential field. Romney took 19 percent, while Bush came in second with 14 percent support; with Romney out of the race, Bush would lead with 16 percent support, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 12 percent. Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.  \n",

       "      <td>a drunk driver who killed a young woman in a head on crash while checking his mobile phone has been jailed for six years. craig eccleston todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. as he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into rachel titleys car coming the other way. craig eccleston todd, 27 was using his mobile phone when he crashed head on into the car being driven by rachel titley, 28 . she died later from her injuries . the head on crash took place in october 2013. mr eccleston todds car was barely recognisable police said eccleston todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. he was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at portsmouth crown court yesterday. miss titley, a 28 year old solicitors clerk from cowes, isle of wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. she was driving responsibly and there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision, they added. lindsay pennell, prosecuting, said craig eccleston todds driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, rachel titley, a death that could have been avoided. mr eccleston todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of miss titleys oncoming car. miss titley was pulled the wreckage of her daihatsu cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . miss titley a bright future ahead of her. she was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. she had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. miss titleys death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand held mobile phone whilst driving. police were unable to take breath or blood tests from eccleston todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink drive limit. the judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red citroen hit miss titleys blue daihatsu cuore on a road near yarmouth, isle of wight, on october 11, 2013. his phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. pc mark furse, from hampshire constabularys serious collision investigation unit, said our thoughts are with rachels family at this time. she had been out with friends at a pub in shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. mr eccleston todd had left work in yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. he hadnt long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. we werent able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. the analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so its highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control. eccleston todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at portsmouth crown court he added mr eccleston todd will now spend six years behind bars, but rachels family have lost her forever. i hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once theyre on the road. the dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison. this case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be. mr eccleston todd will now spend six years behind bars, but rachels family have lost her for ever. i hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once theyre on the road. this case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be. eccleston todd, of newport, isle of wight, was also disqualified from driving for eight years after which he will have to complete an extended re test.</td>\n",

       "      <td>with a breezy sweep of his pen president vladimir putin wrote a new chapter into crimeas turbulent history, committing the region to a future returned to russian domain. sixty years prior, ukraines breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by soviet leader nikita khrushchev. but dealing with such a blatant land grab on its eastern flank wont be anywhere near as quick and easy for europes 28 member union. because, unlike crimeas rushed referendum, everyone has a say. after initially slapping visa restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little known politicians and military men, europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the russian business community in particular. the logic of this is that those who run russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. alexei navalny, one time moscow mayoral contender now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called for europes leaders to ban everyone from vladimir putins personal banker to chelsea football club owner roman abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. asset freezes and visa restrictions are especially palatable options for the eu because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. in fact russia cancels visas for people it doesnt like all the time. just look at hermitage capital founder bill browder who lost both his right of entry and moscow based money in 2005 and dare not go back. russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by americans in retaliation for the uss implementation of an anti corruption law named after sergei magnitsky, browders lawyer who died after a year in a moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. yet in playing the money talks card, europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. because money also walks. as such eu leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two way street and will hurt both sides. targeting russias peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for president putin. and such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining awarding eu countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money laundering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like london property and picasso paintings for years. where europe should hold fire though is trade. two decades of post soviet rapprochement and almost 500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake. its true that any trade war would hurt russia far harder than it would the eu not least because 15 of the formers gdp comes from exports to the bloc. but europe with its hefty reliance on russian gas would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. and while putin flexes his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. no one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with europes economy on the rebound and russias one on the wane.</td>\n",
