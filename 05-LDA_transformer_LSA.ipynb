issued a response to criticism, stating the artistic statement of the photographer sebastian kim, author of this editorial, is in line with his previous photographic creations, which insist on the melting pot and the mix of cultures, the exact opposite of any skin color based discrimination. num\\u00e9ro has always supported the artistic freedom of the talented photographers who work with the magazine to illustrate its pages, and has not took part in the creation process of this editorial. for its part, num\\u00e9ro magazine, which has the utmost respect for this photographers creative work, firmly excludes that the latest may have had, at any moment, the intention to hurt readers sensitivity, whatever their origin. num\\u00e9ro magazine considers that it has regularly demonstrated its deep attachment to the promotion of different skin colored models. for instance, the next issue of num\\u00e9ro for man on sale on 15th march has the black model fernando cabral on the cover page, and the current russian editions cover of our magazine features the black model naomi campbell on its cover. this demonstrates the completely inappropriate nature of the accusations made against our magazine, deeply committed to the respect for differences, tolerance and more generally to non discrimination. considering the turmoil caused by this publication, the management of num\\u00e9ro

. a teenage muslim convert accused of planning to behead a british soldier told police he would harm prime minister david cameron if he had the chance, a court heard. brustholm ziamani, 19, was arrested in east london last august carrying a 12 inch knife and a pick hammer wrapped in an islamic flag after boasting how he was going to kill soldiers. he was previously questioned by counter terror police over extremist posts he made online after an earlier arrest last june, his trial at the old bailey heard today. in an exchange from one interview read to the jury, he said he would do harm to the prime minister if he had the opportunity. he was asked by officers to confirm what he had said in a previous interview, in which the tape recorder had broken. the officer said what would you do if you saw david cameron and had an opportunity you said you would do him harm if he had no security around ziamani replied yes. he also put posts on facebook under the name mujahid karim supporting sharia law and stating he was willing to die in the cause of allah, the jury heard. a letter written by ziamani to his parents in which he talked about being martyred and also the murder of fusilier lee rigby in woolwich in may 2013 was also discussed in the interviews. he told police he didnt disagree with the brutal murder of lee rigby and felt it was justified because he had taken part in killing innocent muslims in afghanistan. dc david atkinson of the counter terrorist command, who stopped ziamani on the street, told the court he was wanted by police because he had been posting messages on facebook that encouraged terrorism. dc atkinson said when he stopped the 19 year old, he found a large knife and a hammer in his possession. when the knife and hammer were discovered, ziamani allegedly told officers you havent asked me what they are for. he was interviewed at walworth police station in the presence of his solicitor and said he was upset about the system and the way nothing was being done. ziamani said he was angry muslims were being so laid back and not doing anything about it. in court the jury heard he also put posts on facebook under the name mujahid karim supporting sharia law and stating he was willing to die in the cause of allah. above, a court sketch of ziamani made yesterday . ziamani boasted he was part of the islamic state of ireland and britain in a chilling five page letter to his parents. in the letter for his christian family he had turned his back on, he boasted that he planned to do a 911 and 77 and woolwich all in one day. he warned you want war you got it. british soldiers heads will be removed and burned, u cannot defeat the muslims. we love to die the way you love to live. ziamani told hmp wandsworth security officer paul morris he was on his way to behead a british soldier when he was arrested. he also boasted of knowing one of lee rigbys murderers, michael adebolajo, and muslim hate cleric anjem choudary. he said that he had been arrested and he was on his way to an army barracks, he didnt say where, and said he was going to behead a british soldier and hold his head in the air while a friend unknown was going to photograph him doing so, mr morris told the jury. he was very, very calm. very matter of fact. mr morris had gone to ziamanis single occupancy cell alone for a welfare visit and to see how radical or extreme he may be, the court heard. the guard offered him a chance to see one of two imams at the prison, the jury heard. he said he had already met an imam, had a disagreement with him and said his ideology would not be changed by anyone, mr morris said. we were just having a general chat. he was very polite, very respectful to be fair. he told me he was arrested by police with weapons in his rucksack i believe, the officer continued. he said he knew michael adebolajo, mr morris said, adding he said he loved him and also said he used to hand out islamic leaflets in greenwich with him as well. copycat ziamanis ambition was to allegedly carry out an attack like one one in woolwich by extremists michael adebolajo and michael adebowale, left and right, who killed lee rigby, the court heard yesterday . asked if he was worried, mr morris replied i was very concerned. he just seemed so calm, so direct in the way he described. he said theres nothing i can do to help him. theres nothing we can do to change his ideology. ziamani also asked about belmarsh prison where his real brothers were and said he knew members of islamic group al muhajiroun, known as alm and mentioned anjem choudary, the court heard. the prison guard said he offered ziamani help in the form of a mentor. mr ziamani was not interested. he said my ideology will not be changed by anybody, he added. the court has previously heard he researched the location of army cadet bases in the south east of the capital. ziamani denies planning a terrorist attack. the trial continues. sorry we are

              "94144   on trial brustholm ziamani, 19, was arrested while carrying a 12 inch knife and a hammer and said he would harm david cameron if he had the chance, the old bailey heard today . a teenage muslim convert accused of planning to behead a british soldier told police he would harm prime minister david cameron if he had the chance, a court heard. brustholm ziamani, 19, was arrested in east london last august carrying a 12 inch knife and a pick hammer wrapped in an islamic flag after boasting how he was going to kill soldiers. he was previously questioned by counter terror police over extremist posts he made online after an earlier arrest last june, his trial at the old bailey heard today. in an exchange from one interview read to the jury, he said he would do harm to the prime minister if he had the opportunity. he was asked by officers to confirm what he had said in a previous interview, in which the tape recorder had broken. the officer said what would you do if you saw david cameron and had an opportunity you said you would do him harm if he had no security around ziamani replied yes. he also put posts on facebook under the name mujahid karim supporting sharia law and stating he was willing to die in the cause of allah, the jury heard. a letter written by ziamani to his parents in which he talked about being martyred and also the murder of fusilier lee rigby in woolwich in may 2013 was also discussed in the interviews. he told police he didnt disagree with the brutal murder of lee rigby and felt it was justified because he had taken part in killing innocent muslims in afghanistan. dc david atkinson of the counter terrorist command, who stopped ziamani on the street, told the court he was wanted by police because he had been posting messages on facebook that encouraged terrorism. dc atkinson said when he stopped the 19 year old, he found a large knife and a hammer in his possession. when the knife and hammer were discovered, ziamani allegedly told officers you havent asked me what they are for. he was interviewed at walworth police station in the presence of his solicitor and said he was upset about the system and the way nothing was being done. ziamani said he was angry muslims were being so laid back and not doing anything about it. in court the jury heard he also put posts on facebook under the name mujahid karim supporting sharia law and stating he was willing to die in the cause of allah. above, a court sketch of ziamani made yesterday . ziamani boasted he was part of the islamic state of ireland and britain in a chilling five page letter to his parents. in the letter for his christian family he had turned his back on, he boasted that he planned to do a 911 and 77 and woolwich all in one day. he warned you want war you got it. british soldiers heads will be removed and burned, u cannot defeat the muslims. we love to die the way you love to live. ziamani told hmp wandsworth security officer paul morris he was on his way to behead a british soldier when he was arrested. he also boasted of knowing one of lee rigbys murderers, michael adebolajo, and muslim hate cleric anjem choudary. he said that he had been arrested and he was on his way to an army barracks, he didnt say where, and said he was going to behead a british soldier and hold his head in the air while a friend unknown was going to photograph him doing so, mr morris told the jury. he was very, very calm. very matter of fact. mr morris had gone to ziamanis single occupancy cell alone for a welfare visit and to see how radical or extreme he may be, the court heard. the guard offered him a chance to see one of two imams at the prison, the jury heard. he said he had already met an imam, had a disagreement with him and said his ideology would not be changed by anyone, mr morris said. we were just having a general chat. he was very polite, very respectful to be fair. he told me he was arrested by police with weapons in his rucksack i believe, the officer continued. he said he knew michael adebolajo, mr morris said, adding he said he loved him and also said he used to hand out islamic leaflets in greenwich with him as well. copycat ziamanis ambition was to allegedly carry out an attack like one one in woolwich by extremists michael adebolajo and michael adebowale, left and right, who killed lee rigby, the court heard yesterday . asked if he was worried, mr morris replied i was very concerned. he just seemed so calm, so direct in the way he described. he said theres nothing i can do to help him. theres nothing we can do to change his ideology. ziamani also asked about belmarsh prison where his real brothers were and said he knew members of islamic group al muhajiroun, known as alm and mentioned anjem choudary, the court heard. the prison guard said he offered ziamani help in the form of a mentor. mr ziamani was not interested. he said my ideology will not be changed by anybody, he added. the court has previously heard he researched the location of army cadet bases in the south east of the capital. ziamani denies planning a terrorist attack. the trial continues. sorry we are not currently

zak rowlands, 19, who cannot speak and suffers with autism and severe learning difficulties, was assaulted and called a stupid boy by stanley nkenka on his birthday. when his parents noticed the vulnerable teenager was flinching, they set up a hidden camera at oxen barn residential home in leyland, lancashire, and captured nkenkas abusive behaviour. zak rowlands, 19, who cannot speak and suffers with autism and severe learning difficulties, was assaulted and called a stupid boy by stanley nkenka on his birthday . the care worker was seen hitting the vulnerable teenager, throwing him to the bed and calling him a stupid boy. nkenka, 36, from bolton, pleaded guilty at preston crown court last month to ill treatment of a person without mental capacity in the early hours of may 12. the footage showed nkenka bringing mr rowlands back to his bedroom after he wandered off during the night before hitting him. as the youngster lay in darkness, he later approached him and quietly said do you want some more before he went on to strike him again on the back of the head on a separate occasion. when his parents noticed the vulnerable teenager was flinching, they set up a hidden camera at oxen barn residential home in leyland, lancashire zak rowlands father paul said nkenka has damaged the fragile trust they have in the care of their precious son . judge christopher cornwall said the ill treatment that is complained of seems to me to be dismissive of him as an individual, unkind and uncaring, and really disrespectful of him as a human being. carers must know that if they fall so far below the standards that are expected of them to the extent that they ill treat the people they care for, they must know they put their liberty at jeopardy. oxen barn privately run by the priory group is a specialist home for adults who have autistic spectrum disorders and severe learning difficulties. mr rowlands mother julie said she felt sick, heartbroken and angry when she saw the hidden camera footage. sadly zak, my loving, affectionate, special and incredibly vulnerable son hasnt the mental capacity to be able to speak but he communicates in his own way, she told the court. by making sounds and by the sparkle in his eyes when hes happy and by the tears and the sorrow in his eyes when hes sad or hurt. but when thats not enough i am my sons voice and will always be until i take my last breath. she said she knew something was wrong when her son started to flinch when he was touched or approached. when i saw the video recording of nkenka hitting him, i felt sick, heartbroken, angry and incredibly guilty, she said. its hard to articulate the actual words that really describe my emotions. im scared, really scared that it will happen again. i have to trust the people that care for him because as much as i dont like it i havent got a choice. weve been to look for other places closer to home so that i can keep a closer eye on him. i miss him so much but we cant find anywhere that is suitable. her husband, paul, said each day there is as good as it gets and the impact that you have on these vulnerable people and their families is immeasurable. whether it be a good one as is the case with many carers or a bad one as is the case with you. you have damaged the fragile trust that we have in the care of our precious son and that damage can never be fully undone. earlier this year, two care workers working for another priory group company in bury were jailed for seven months after they were caught on a secret camera physically and verbally abusing a

one interview read to the jury, he said he would do harm to the prime minister if he had the opportunity. he was asked by officers to confirm what he had said in a previous interview, in which the tape recorder had broken. the officer said what would you do if you saw david cameron and had an opportunity you said you would do him harm if he had no security around ziamani replied yes. he also put posts on facebook under the name mujahid karim supporting sharia law and stating he was willing to die in the cause of allah, the jury heard. a letter written by ziamani to his parents in which he talked about being martyred and also the murder of fusilier lee rigby in woolwich in may 2013 was also discussed in the interviews. he told police he didnt disagree with the brutal murder of lee rigby and felt it was justified because he had taken part in killing innocent muslims in afghanistan. dc david atkinson of the counter terrorist command, who stopped ziamani on the street, told the court he was wanted by police because he had been posting messages on facebook that encouraged terrorism. dc atkinson said when he stopped the 19 year old, he found a large knife and a hammer in his possession. when the knife and hammer were discovered, ziamani allegedly told officers you havent asked me what they are for. he was interviewed at walworth police station in the presence of his solicitor and said he was upset about the system and the way nothing was being done. ziamani said he was angry muslims were being so laid back and not doing anything about it. in court the jury heard he also put posts on facebook under the name mujahid karim supporting sharia law and stating he was willing to die in the cause of allah. above, a court sketch of ziamani made yesterday . ziamani boasted he was part of the islamic state of ireland and britain in a chilling five page letter to his parents. in the letter for his christian family he had turned his back on, he boasted that he planned to do a 911 and 77 and woolwich all in one day. he warned you want war you got it. british soldiers heads will be removed and burned, u cannot defeat the muslims. we love to die the way you love to live. ziamani told hmp wandsworth security officer paul morris he was on his way to behead a british soldier when he was arrested. he also boasted of knowing one of lee rigbys murderers, michael adebolajo, and muslim hate cleric anjem choudary. he said that he had been arrested and he was on his way to an army barracks, he didnt say where, and said he was going to behead a british soldier and hold his head in the air while a friend unknown was going to photograph him doing so, mr morris told the jury. he was very, very calm. very matter of fact. mr morris had gone to ziamanis single occupancy cell alone for a welfare visit and to see how radical or extreme he may be, the court heard. the guard offered him a chance to see one of two imams at the prison, the jury heard. he said he had already met an imam, had a disagreement with him and said his ideology would not be changed by anyone, mr morris said. we were just having a general chat. he was very polite, very respectful to be fair. he told me he was arrested by police with weapons in his rucksack i believe, the officer continued. he said he knew michael adebolajo, mr morris said, adding he said he loved him and also said he used to hand out islamic leaflets in greenwich with him as well. copycat ziamanis ambition was to allegedly carry out an attack like one one in woolwich by extremists michael adebolajo and michael adebowale, left and right, who killed lee rigby, the court heard yesterday . asked if he was worried, mr morris replied i was very concerned. he just seemed so calm, so direct in the way he described. he said theres nothing i can do to help him. theres nothing we can do to change his ideology. ziamani also asked about belmarsh prison where his real brothers were and said he knew members of islamic group al muhajiroun, known as alm and mentioned anjem choudary, the court heard. the prison guard said he offered ziamani help in the form of a mentor. mr ziamani was not interested. he said my ideology will not be changed by anybody, he added. the court has previously heard he researched the location of army cadet bases in the south east of the capital. ziamani denies

teenager on the back of the head has been jailed for six months. zak rowlands, 19, who cannot speak and suffers with autism and severe learning difficulties, was assaulted and called a stupid boy by stanley nkenka on his birthday. when his parents noticed the vulnerable teenager was flinching, they set up a hidden camera at oxen barn residential home in leyland, lancashire, and captured nkenkas abusive behaviour. zak rowlands, 19, who cannot speak and suffers with autism and severe learning difficulties, was assaulted and called a stupid boy by stanley nkenka on his birthday . the care worker was seen hitting the vulnerable teenager, throwing him to the bed and calling him a stupid boy. nkenka, 36, from bolton, pleaded guilty at preston crown court last month to ill treatment of a person without mental capacity in the early hours of may 12. the footage showed nkenka bringing mr rowlands back to his bedroom after he wandered off during the night before hitting him. as the youngster lay in darkness, he later approached him and quietly said do you want some more before he went on to strike him again on the back of the head on a separate occasion. when his parents noticed the vulnerable teenager was flinching, they set up a hidden camera at oxen barn residential home in leyland, lancashire zak rowlands father paul said nkenka has damaged the fragile trust they have in the care of their precious son . judge christopher cornwall said the ill treatment that is complained of seems to me to be dismissive of him as an individual, unkind and uncaring, and really disrespectful of him as a human being. carers must know that if they fall so far below the standards that are expected of them to the extent that they ill treat the people they care for, they must know they put their liberty at jeopardy. oxen barn privately run by the priory group is a specialist home for adults who have autistic spectrum disorders and severe learning difficulties. mr rowlands mother julie said she felt sick, heartbroken and angry when she saw the hidden camera footage. sadly zak, my loving, affectionate, special and incredibly vulnerable son hasnt the mental capacity to be able to speak but he communicates in his own way, she told the court. by making sounds and by the sparkle in his eyes when hes happy and by the tears and the sorrow in his eyes when hes sad or hurt. but when thats not enough i am my sons voice and will always be until i take my last breath. she said she knew something was wrong when her son started to flinch when he was touched or approached. when i saw the video recording of nkenka hitting him, i felt sick, heartbroken, angry and incredibly guilty, she said. its hard to articulate the actual words that really describe my emotions. im scared, really scared that it will happen again. i have to trust the people that care for him because as much as i dont like it i havent got a choice. weve been to look for other places closer to home so that i can keep a closer eye on him. i miss him so much but we cant find anywhere that is suitable. her husband, paul, said each day there is as good as it gets and the impact that you have on these vulnerable people and their families is immeasurable. whether it be a good one as is the case with many carers or a bad one as is the case with you. you have damaged the fragile trust that we have in the care of our precious son and that damage can never be fully undone. earlier this year, two care workers working for another priory group company in bury were jailed for seven months after they were caught on a secret camera physically and verbally abusing a quadriplegic man.   \n",

holiday makers in australia have reported getting automated messages purporting to be from qantas or virgin australia, informing them that they have been chosen to receive 999 towards a holiday. they are then asked to press one on their phones, and are directed to consultants who ask for personal and financial information. bogus the qantas name is being used by scammers attempting to get financial information from people . qantas and virgin have also issued warnings about the scam, which has nothing to do with either airline. consumers, businesses and airlines are all reporting the scam, said the fair trading minister for new south wales, mr mason cox. there is no end to the variety of scams or the devious devices scammers will employ to take peoples money and personal information. the promise of a credit on flights may be appealing but i urge people to hang up on these calls. mr mason cox said scammers attempt to lure people in by asking them for some personal information needed to enable them to redeem their prize. typically they have been asking for the persons age and if they have a valid credit card, he said.scammers can obtain peoples private numbers fraudulently or from anywhere it has been publicly listed. hang up scammers attempt to lure people in by asking them for some personal information needed to enable them to redeem their prize . and people can still receive scam calls even if they have a private number or have listed their number on the australian governments do not call register. information about the scam can be found on the scam watch website, which advises scamwatch and qantas are warning people about automated calls from scammers posing as qantas staff claiming that theyve won a credit towards their next holiday. if you receive this call, hang up...if you hand over your credit card details, you will find that money has been taken rather than deposited from your bank account. the scammers are persistent, according to reports, with some consumers and businesses saying they have received several such calls in one day. qantas stated on its website we are aware that some customers are receiving automated phone calls purporting to be from qantas. these calls are not from us, and can easily be identified as unauthentic. qantas consultants will always call customers directly to discuss their bookings and do not use an automated phone system when contacting customers proactively. qantas also points out that calls are being made to people who are not even customers of qantas. people took to twitter to warn others about the scam, with one tweeter warning, i just had a robocall claiming to be from qantas that i won 999 towards my next holiday. no surprise, its a scam. another tweeted received clever scam phone call today , past booked flights allowed us 945 credit, needed to give cc.   \n",

           youtube is a source of entertainment and news for billions around the world, but pakistanis have lost access to the video site for almost a year after clips of the controversial film innocence of muslims prompted a government ban. that ban will be challenged for the first time in court wednesday and activists, as well as artists, some of whose careers were launched on youtube, are keeping their fingers crossed. rapper, singer and songwriter adil omar is a musician that has relied on social networking sites to launch his career. even without a record label, he successfully used youtube to reach both a domestic and international audience collaborating with international artists like cypress hill, everlast, xzibit and guitarist slash from guns n roses. producer of anti islam film on supervised release . youtube has put me out there internationally. ive worked with major artists, been in the mainstream press, omar said. but soon after the youtube ban, response to his album plummeted. im getting about a tenth of the promotion i was getting before and i have about a tenth of the sales i was initially getting, he said. numbers on youtube reflect his comment. omars last major single paki rambo, released before the youtube ban, generated more than 320,000 hits. one of his first singles after the ban got just over 30,000 clicks. protests erupted across the arab world last year when trailers for innocence of muslims, an anti islam film that mocks the prophet mohammed, appeared online. youtube is not the only social media website that was taken away from pakistani web users. facebook, twitter and tumblr all have been banned in the past. the recent ban on youtube, however, is the longest running act of online censorship in pakistans history. bytes for all, an organization that fights for digital rights in pakistan, has worked to lift this censorship running a poster campaign, filing petitions and writing to the u.n. special rapporteur for freedom of expression. we do not need dictatorial nannies to tell people what to watch and what not to watch and what decision to take and how to take it. because after all, its a democracy. its not a dictatorship anymore, said furhan hussain from bytes for all. the ban on youtube is in direct violation of the constitution of pakistan. it violates the fundamental human rights of freedom of expression and freedom of access to information of the citizens of pakistan, he said. cnn reached out for comment repeatedly to pakistans minister of information technology but got no response. omar, like the activists from bytes for all, hopes the ban will be lifted soon. what id like to see happen is for youtube to open up again. for pakistani artists and musicians to be able to earn money again and make a living ... to be able to reach an international audience again.   \n",

no closer on saturday to discovering what agreement if any might be struck with the current regime in a deal for acceptance of their 6.5million funding rescue package. as wealthy rangers minded businessmen douglas park, george letham and george taylor wait and hope for a resolution in the coming days amid gravely uncertain times for the club, there remains mystery, too, concerning the involvement of the football man linked to their push for change. felix magath, the former bayern munich and fulham manager, was in glasgow over a week ago for discussions with a representative of the group and it has been revealed that the 61 year old is keen to adopt a technical director style role. felix magath purchased a one per cent stake in finacially troubled rangers last week . one friend and former colleague is convinced that a man of magaths stature, talent and knowledge would be a brilliant asset to rangers. nevertheless, he is baffled by the development that the german would consider turning his back on management to seek such a role at a scottish club where finances are tight and entirely unpredictable. mark mcghee was a team mate of magath at hamburg in the 1980s and their relationship has continued throughout their coaching careers nearly 30 years on. mcghee has recruited players on the recommendation of the german, most recently at bristol rovers, and the pair met up again to talk football when scotland played a friendly against nigeria at fulhams craven cottage stadium last summer. the scotland assistant manager was linked with a role at fulham during magaths brief reign in charge but that never came off and his first stint in britain ended with the sack in september. in the wake of his dismissal, magath maintained his methods would be suitable for the english game and stressed that his next job would be in the uk. the former fulham manager has held talks about taking on a director style role at the club . mcghee, however, does not view a rebuilding job of rangers from top to bottom as an obvious attraction for his friend. mcghee said if felix is up for trying to turn rangers around as a club on the football side, then they will have a great asset because he is a top man. he is studious, intelligent and bright. he is also very single minded, always with a very clear picture of what he wants from players and people around him. he does not compromise much on that. he has a fairly established model of how he thinks it should be done and what he wants to do. he has a great work ethic and requires that of his players. so rangers would certainly get their moneys worth with him. but if its a director of football role or technical director, then i cant imagine what he will do if there is no money to spend on players. from what i know of him, he would be frustrated. i find it a bit mysterious. if he is finished as a manager, then thats a surprise to me. to give up now thats a bit of a mystery. scotland assistant mark mcghee played with magath at hamburg and finds the mystifying . magath was unveiled last week as having a one per cent stake in rangers, an investment of 200,000. his interest is understood to extend to wishing to overhaul murray park where the rangers development and scouting areas have been stripped to the bare bones over years of mismanagement and disregard by the hierarchy. mcghee added to be fair, felix is a gambler, a punter. he doesnt mind speculating. so it could be theres a bit of that going on which he finds attractive. id have thought, though, someone of his champions league credentials would still have commanded a big money post. one of the things felix requires is control, so i cant imagine him going anywhere and staying long where he will have to kowtow to anyone. if hes given autonomy, then the move could work. mcghee praised magaths football knowledge and said he would be a fantastic asset to rangers . magath will be waiting in the wings to see if the three bears can seize control at ibrox. some hurdles were cleared during last weeks talks but there remain others to be addressed with the main stumbling blocks being the make up of any new rangers board. it is believed the rangers friendly consortium are cautiously optimistic of striking a deal early in the week. both parties should be keen to reach a resolution without the costly and lengthy resort of an egm but that would be the most likely step if the proposal is not accepted by the current regime. phoenix suns basketball owner robert sarvers camp have yet to learn of the rangers boards response, either, to his improved offer of 20m, including a short term 6.5m loan. sarver was told his earlier 18m bid was thrown out because it undervalued the club. his push is unlikely to succeed as he requires 75 per cent support but the parklethamtaylor alliance plus dave king control 33 per cent of votes.   \n",

subject of investigations by corruption watchdog icac, resigned as assistant treasurer on friday, fuelling rumours the prime minister is about to reshuffle his cabinet. mr abbott has publicly stated that changes were on the cards and there are reports that the front bench overhaul could take place as early as this weekend. the pms recent concession that there are one or two barnacles still on the ship but by christmas they will have been dealt with does not bode well for under fire defence minister david johnston. last month he gained notoriety for his statement about australian submarine corporation in parliament of you wonder why i wouldnt trust them to build a canoe. the icac findings on senator arthur sinodinos, due early next year, was seen as pivotal to the major reshuffle of the federal cabinet, however, the senate officially resigned as assistant treasurer on friday . tony abbotts flagging popularity, which sees him trailing opposition leader bill shorten by eight points as preferred pm and the coalitions dip in voter support has a major cabinet reshuffle on the cards . there are suggestions tony abbott could dump david johnston from the defence portfolio as early as this weekend but any moves against the embattled defence minister could ignite tensions with foreign minister julie bishop, a known supporter of the senator . pivotal to the shake up by tony abbott will be two roles the troubled portfolio of defence under the watch of senator johnston and the assistant treasurer position now relinquished by senator sinodinos. a minor reshuffle of the ranks could be put in place before the new working week while a major overhaul of the senior ministry is more likely by the end of january. asked recently whether it was time to reshape the coalition front bench, mr abbott said at some stage between now and the next election, quite probably, but this is a good front bench. three weeks ago he conceded it had been a tough year at the top and famously stated there are one or two barnacles still on the ship but by christmas they will have been dealt with. the sydney morning herald reports that a source believes the threshold question is arthur . the pm doesnt want arthur to be in the mix but he is. mr abbott was waiting on the outcome of the icac inquiry into senator sinodinos, which was due in january but could now be delayed. its believed he will escape any official sanctions over the inquiry into his involvement with australian water holdings. the need, in the eyes of some senior mps, to get senator sinodinos back in the fold as soon as possible was given more currency due to the pressure which has steadily built on treasurer joe hockey over his stalled budget measures. senator david johnston has been under intense pressure since claiming parliament that he would trust the asc to build canoes and revelations of lavish wining and dining . but senator sinodinos will not return to that prominent position, after announcing his resignation effective friday. the newspaper also claims that mr abbott favours a tweak of the front bench ahead of bigger changes nearing the end of next year, leading into the 2016 poll. still, any moves against the defence minister could ignite tensions between the pm and the foreign minister julie bishop, a known supporter of senator johnston. the success of ms bishop, however, has led to internal calls for more women to ascend to the coalition front bench with higgins mp, kelly odwyer, seen as a likely candidate for promotion. with the opinion polls showing the prime minister and coalition losing popularity fast, a reshuffle is seen as pivotal by senior coalition members. mr abbott now trails opposition leader bill shorten by 8 points as preferred prime minister, 47 to 39 and labor holds a four point lead on two party preferred basis, 52 per cent to 48.   \n",

reverting to its old policy on user information for now. backlash against facebook began after a consumer advocate site flagged facebooks policy change. the site posted a brief message on users home pages that said it was returning to its previous terms of use policy while we resolve the issues that people have raised. the terms of use is the legalese tacked on to the bottom of most web sites that details what the sites owners can do with the information that users provide. facebook, the webs most popular social networking site, has been caught in a content rights battle after revealing earlier this month that it was granting itself permanent rights to users photos, wall posts and other information even after a user closed an account. the popular site allows users to create personal profiles where they can then connect with one another, upload photos and share links. the site boasts more than 150 million active users. member backlash against facebook began over the weekend after a consumer advocate web site, the consumerist, flagged a change made to facebooks policy earlier in the month. the company deleted a sentence from the old terms of use. that sentence said facebook could not claim any rights to original content that a user uploaded once the user closed his or her account. it replaced it with you may remove your user content from the site at any time. ... owever, you acknowledge that the company may retain archived copies of your user content. in response, chris walters wrote in the consumerist post, make sure you never upload anything you dont feel comfortable giving away forever, because its facebooks now. thousands of indignant members either canceled their accounts or created online petitions. among them were more than 64,000 who joined a group called the people against the new terms of service. ireport.com too much information posted online on monday, facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg tried to quell the controversy by saying the companys philosophy is that people own their information and control who they share it with. but members were not appeased because the site did not fix its terms of use. the company, in its post wednesday, said it was returning to its previous terms of use because of the feedback it had received. as mark expressed in his blog post on monday, it was never our intention to confuse people or make them uneasy about sharing on facebook, company spokesman barry schnitt said in a blog post. i also want to be very clear that facebook does not, nor have we ever, claimed ownership over peoples content. your content belongs to you. ireport.com your thoughts on facebooks about face . schnitt said the company is in the process of rewording its terms of use in simple language that defines facebooks rights much more specifically. well that worked pretty fast, wrote member al reford of vancouver, british columbia. numbers count when giving feedback and shahrzad grami of st. paul, minnesota, added yayyyyyyyyyyy nice job guys i wont be canceling my account after all.   \n",

washington the senate has moved quickly, in washington terms, to confirm a replacement for slain federal judge john roll, killed in the mass shooting at a tucson shopping center in january. jennifer guerin zipps was elevated from a magistrate to a seat on the u.s. district court in arizona. she works in the same tucson courthouse as her predecessor. as a former federal prosecutor zipps, 47, had appeared often in rolls courtroom. president barack obama nominated zipps in june, and she was confirmed late monday by a senate voice vote. the seat was declared a judicial emergency because of rolls death, other bench vacancies, and a rapidly growing caseload fueled by illegal immigration cases. senate judiciary chairman patrick leahy, d vermont, praised the bipartisan cooperation that led to the relatively swift action on zipps, saying it sets the benchmark for how judicial nominations should be being treated. senate democrats have been pushing for similar action on another pending district court nominee in arizona, rosemary marquez. five other judicial nominees also were confirmed by the senate this week. democrats and republicans have been at odds over the pace of confirming judges for lifetime positions on the federal bench. sen. charles grassley, r iowa, ranking gop member on the judiciary committee criticized the president for not moving faster to fill the roll vacancy. it was deemed to be a judicial emergency instantly. however, it took over five months for the administration to nominate zipps, grassley said. roll, 63, was among five killed by gunfire outside a safeway store january 8. thirteen others were wounded, including rep. gabrielle giffords, d arizona. the suspect, jared lee loughner, is being forcibly medicated to determine whether he will someday be competent to stand trail on capital murder charges.   \n",

refusing to ticket a car parked on double yellow lines and eventually admits that its because it belongs to his own boss. the warden, who was on patrol in swansea, south wales, was confronted by an indignant member of the public who noticed that one car had escaped punishment. steve mcmillan, who filmed the encounter on his phone, asked the warden repeatedly why he had refused to ticket the car, to which the flustered official replied that he was acting on his discretion. scroll down for video . my discretion a parking attendant in swansea is confronted over his decision not to ticket a car and it eventually emerges it belongs to his boss . when pressed on the matter by mr mcmillan who insisted he had no such right to refuse the ticket the warden insisted that he did. eventually another warden entered the fray, and revealed another reason the ticket was allegedly withheld, saying thats my bosss car. a second video filmed by mr mcmillan then shows the man in question swansea parking services deputy manager steve sheriff entering the argument. on business a second warden, left, later points out that the car belongs to his boss steve sheriff, right, who then arrives and attempts to defend himself . the suited man who identifies himself as mr sheriff when asked attempts to explain that he is parking there for business reasons, which mr mcmillan tells him is not a valid reason. he initially compares himself to the police who are allowed to disregard parking laws in certain circumstances but later gives up on the line of argument. when asked whether his logic applied to anybody who has business reasons for parking on double yellow lines, mr sheriff does not give a clear answer, but seems to leave the confrontation seemingly without a ticket. swansea city council was not available to comment. part one confrontation and wriggling from the parking attendant . steve mcmillan how come you just allowed somebody to park on double yellow lines warden 1 ive got discretion... thats for me to know... its privileged information, sir.. im allowed to give discretion for people. mr mcmillan i disagree, sir, because thats not fair... were all equal people, you have no right to leave that vehicle parked there. part two the truth emerges . mr mcmillan im just asking the question how come youve allowed that car to park there for more than five minutes on double yellows and then walked away from the situation warden 2 what that car there thats my bosss car. mr mcmillan it doesnt matter whether its your bosss car, does it warden 2 i think youd better go speak to him yourself, sir. part three im on business mr mcmillan how come youre allowed to park on double yellow lines for more than five minutes mr sheriff im actually on business at the moment. mr mcmillan that doesnt matter... why is it fair for you to park on business and not me mr sheriff it depends on what youre doing. mr mcmillan but no, it doesnt. part four the admission . mr sheriff all right, i shouldnt have really parked there. mr mcmillan i just dont think thats fair. part five the last ditch attempt . warden 1 im using my discretion. mr mcmillan youre not a police officer, sir, you have a job to follow and if youre not doing it and booking this car youre in breach of your own rules and regulations. part six the coup de grace . mr mcmillan police have discretion, they are allowed to park on double yellow lines if they have blue lights on. do you have blue lights on top of this vehicle mr sheriff no. mr mcmillan are you a police officer mr sheriff no. mr mcmillan youre a manager whos high up within the parking industry. i think its despicable.   \n",

week in a bid to counter claims of being unpatriotic. poppy stalls will be set up at around the country leading up to remembrance sunday in a move backed by government ministers and the royal british legion. it follows high profile protests . in the past by muslim extremists, including those linked to the hate . preacher anjem choudary, and the murder of drummer lee rigby outside . woolwich barracks in south east london. members of muslims against crusaders burning a large poppy at a protest in kensington, west london, in 2010 . britains islamic leaders fear that actions by a minority of extremists have led to a perception amongst some that muslims are unpatriotic or disloyal. one example was a protest held in november 2010 when fanatics set fire to a giant paper poppy outside the albert hall in central london. in a bid to tackle that negative perception, the centenary of the first world war next year will be used to highlight that thousands of muslim soldiers have fought and died for britain, the sunday times reported. tomorrow the communities secretary eric pickles is expected to visit a muslim led poppy stall outside westminster cathedral in central london. stalls will also operate at different locations in the capital this week run by the interfaith charity faiths forum and at mosques in leeds, leicester and southampton. julie siddiqi, the executive director of the islamic society of great britain, told the sunday times british muslims should be wearing poppies not burning them. extremist anjem choudary speaks to a group of demonstrators in central london . she added that the centenary of world war one provided an opportunity to tell young muslims that we are all in this together. how can you question a whole communitys loyalty when thousands died serving this country she said. an estimated 400,000 muslims fought in the war as part of the british indian army, including the sepoy khudadad khan who was awarded the victoria cross for an act of bravery in belgium in 1914. historians put numbers of indians close to 50,000 injured and 8,500 dead on the western front during the war. an estimated third to a half of these war dead were muslims, who fought and died alongside their fellow hindu and sikh countrymen. the bodies of many of these men were never found and their names are listed on the menin gate memorial in ypres, belgium. more than 3.5million soldiers from the asian subcontinent fought for britain in world war one and two, with tens of thousands killed in action. referring to both conflicts, baroness warsi, minister for faith and communities, said sikhs, muslims and hindus courageously battled and lost their lives for a country they had never seen and for a king who was not from their land. it is fantastic that these poppy stalls are raising awareness of this outstanding contribution.   \n",

outside turin has backed the controversial plan to create a segregated bus route for residents of the roma encampment after years of complaints from local residents. inhabitants of the town have allegedly suffered years of aggression and pickpocketing on the current bus route which passes the huge camp, based in a former barracks off the citys ring road. plans for a separate bus route for roma were presented at the town hall in borgaro and were supported by residents . alleged incidents on route 69, known as the gipsy bus have included passengers who were spat on, a young girl whose hair was cut off, and another whose hair was set on fire. under plans which won the mayor claudio gambinos support at a town hall meeting this week, a new bus will run parallel to the current route and end at the roma camp. italian newspaper la stampa said in an editorial that the measures amounted to apartheid but acknowledged that something had to be done. mr gambino, of the centre left pd party, denied racism and said it was the only solution. the town outside turin in north west italy has been accused of instituting an apartheid for its segregation of bus passengers . he told italian media this way we will resolve the problem without anyone losing out, adding it is not about xenophobia, but security and legality. the decision recalls pre civil rights america and apartheid policies carried out in south africa when blacks and whites had to travel on separate public transport. eight out of ten italians take extra care with their wallet if they see a roma person on the bus, according to a poll by avvenire, a catholic newspaper.   \n",

dating american actress michelle rodriguez, says she fell into her phenomenal catwalk career as a backup when she suffered rejection in the acting world. i started auditioning for movies before i started modelling but i couldnt deal with the rejection. when i got turned down for something it would take me weeks to get over it, she says. however it seems that taking a less than linear path into her acting career has served her well. in timeless, cara plays a young woman whose fiance is a soldier serving in afghanistan and the experience brings her closer to her great grandmother, played by syms . cara certainly seemed to ooze confidence as she was seen out for the evening with suki waterhouse on wednesday in london . the model has previously only given fans a tiny snapshot of her thespian skills appearing in a short film for karl largerfeld. all reports suggest cara has successfully made the leap from catwalk to small screen in her television debut, timeless, a short film which will be shown on the sky arts channel. stills from the show, which is to be . screened later this year as part of the playhouse presents season, suggest that far from a token cameo role, cara has taken on a . meaty, highly emotional part. the blonde seemed to be in high spirits and showing no sign of self doubt, as she enjoyed a catch up with talented co star sylvia syms . in timeless, cara plays a young woman whose fiance is a soldier serving in afghanistan and the experience brings her closer to her great grandmother, played by syms, who was also separated from her partner due to

firm hearst, has left his job after explicit texts he allegedly sent to a stripper were seen by his bosses . a high flying executive has resigned from a top job with one of americas biggest media firms after sexually explicit text messages allegedly sent between him and a stripper were forwarded to his bosses. scott sassa, 53, left his role as president of hearst entertainment and syndication group after the woman apparently forwarded the explicit messages to senior figures at the company. mr sassa, who was responsible for the firms interests in cable television networks, including espn and lifetime, is alleged to have sent the texts to the la based stripper and arranged to meet up with her. the woman, who has not been named, is believed to have sent mr sassa who is a single father of two revealing pictures of herself during the exchanges. she is accused of trying to blackmail him by threatening to forward the messages to his bosses at hearst unless he paid her money. she was helped by her boyfriend in trying to extort money out of mr sassa who has also held senior positions at fox, nbc, friendster and marvel entertainment, the new york post reports. he is thought to have met the stripper in la in december. the stripper is believed to have made a list of demands, but mr sassa refused to pay the money. her boyfriend then emailed the text messages to executives at hearst, according to the post. among those thought to have received the messages were hearsts ceo frank bennack jr and michael clinton, president of marketing for the magazines. high flyer mr sassa, a single father of two, has worked in senior roles for other entertainment firms, including nbc . mr sassa is understood to have been asked to resign on tuesday with hearst arranging a large compensation package for him. neither mr sassa or hearst have commented on the matter. mr sassa had previously enjoyed a successful career at nbc, which he joined in 1997 as president of the nbc television stations division and before that at turner broadcasting.   \n",

  australia set the platform for a final day push for victory in the fourth test against india after establishing a 348 run lead with four wickets remaining in sydney. after bowling out india for 475 in the afternoon session to establish a first innings advantage of 97, australias batsmen then went on the offensive as the hosts blazed their way to 251 for six by the close. in form captain steve

and a half runs an over. ashwin had, at least, been able to frustrate australia with the bat earlier, making 50 as the tourists battled their way to 475 all out at the scg after starting the morning on 342 for five. it was not such a good day for india captain virat kohli, though. striding out to the middle, kohli would have hoped to make considerable additions to his overnight 140 but he could add only seven before falling in the fifth over of the day, caught by rogers at midwicket off ryan harris. wriddhiman sahas exit was not much better as josh hazlewood found some bounce and the wicketkeeper was caught in two minds as he top edged to smith at slip to exit for 35. sean abbott, the bowler who bowled the fatal ball to phillip hughes, was the 12th man at the scg . abbott carries

110 balls but fell to the next one he faced as mitchell starc found the edge and brad haddin gobbled up the chance behind the stumps. storm clouds gather over the ground during day four in sydney . indias cricketer suresh raina shouts for a decision against australian batsman chris rogers . mohammed shami hammered 14 off the next over as india crept within a hundred of the australian first innings and umesh yadav got them there with a boundary before top edging harris to haddin to leave shami stranded on 16. that left the tourists with a deficit of 97 but they got off to an excellent start in the field as ashwin found david warners edge and murali vijay took a catch at slip to remove the opener for four. the hosts reached 38 for one at tea but watson was gone shortly after as ashwin found the edge again but this time it was the bottom edge as the all rounder chopped on for 16. australia were looking to attack and smith hit four fours in an over as the lead raced past 200.

just one, edging a beauty from ashwin to vijay at slip. wickets were not halting home momentum, though, as the australians kept the rate up but smith was next to go for 71, trapped in front by shami. with the captain gone having taken his run tally in the series to a phenomenal 769, burns and haddin took matters into their own hands, finding the boundary almost at will and hammering sixes in three consecutive overs to take the lead past 300. burns was the last wicket of the day to fall having made his second 50 of the match when he top edged a sweep off ashwin in what turned out to be the last over, but by then australia had already batted themselves into a powerful position.   \n",

skepticism. if there is a miracle cure for japans decades long malaise, then itll have to be seen to be believed. and abe himself admits it will take time for salaries to rise and for the real economy to respond to treatment. but in tokyos central akihabara district, four young abenomics devotees dressed in giant glittery bow ties and denim mini skirts are handing out fliers. they chant were the street corner economists please come to our concert granted, its less the promise of massive public spending programs, the whirring of the monetary printing press or the slightly ambiguous growth strategies pulling in the punters here. its more about the girl bands coquettish sales pitch. when the economy is good the skirt lengths get shorter, says 20 year old band member yuki sakora. so when the nikkei goes below 9,000 we wear long skirts when its between 10 and 11,000 we go medium length, and miniskirts when its 11 to 13,000. their signature tune abenomics has only been on sale a couple of weeks, but the audience seem to know it. an assortment of geeky 20 something males and the odd suited salaryman faithfully mirror the girls dance routine, punching the air with glow sticks when the refrain comes through. perhaps its because the nikkeis wedged firmly above 13,000, so theyre treated to the girls in bloomers. i ask yuki what abenomics means to her. the weaker yen probably means prices will go up, she says without missing a beat. but that helps exports. and i think companies will start to earn more and that will boost consumer spending. that is the theory but it requires a shift in thinking. our biggest problem is that the general public has been stuck with deflation in mind and heart for the past 20 years, japans finance minister taro aso told cnns jill dougherty recently. people dont buy things today because they think tomorrow it will be cheaper. unless this mindset changes and people start buying things, consumption, which is near 70 of gdp, wont grow. toru urayama set up an academy in 2007 to teach amateur traders how to make money on the markets. in the last few months of the nikkeis meteoric rise hes experienced a flood of applicants. but he tells them not to hold out hope that abenomics will do much in the long term. its good for the stock market but not for the economy as a whole. it could lead to a bubble, though i dont think it will be as bad as it was back in the 1980s, he said, referring to the spectacular crash that followed decades of soaring stock and real estate values in japan. megumi fukuzawas signed up because she made a bad investment in 2008 and is wondering what to do with her money now the markets up. shes hoping abenomics boosts her husbands salary. in the past ive tried to save because his salary was low. but if things change then i might spend more, this stock market investment is part of that. back on stage, the street corner economists finish their song in a blaze of multi colored lights, before they settle in for a chat with the fans. everyone dutifully sits down. but when the girls ask whether anyones bought the single, theres not much of a response. the appeal here is more show than substance. precisely what critics fear so called abenomics will turn out to be too.   \n",

time indianapolis 500 winner dan wheldon died in a fiery, 15 vehicle crash, the racing series said on thursday. wheldons name wasnt mentioned in a news release explaining indycars decision not to have its season ending race next october 14 in nevada, as originally planned. and there was no indication that the circuit had ruled out its drivers coming back another year, after 2012. the move followed consultations between indycar and las vegas motor speedway officials, in which the key parties said considerable testing with the new car is needed prior to returning to the facility, according to the release. the new car for the izod indycar racing series is set to debut next year. we feel we need to give our technical team ample time to conduct thorough testing at las vegas motor speedway, once we complete our ongoing investigation into the october 16 crash, indycar ceo randy bernard said. weeks before the fatal wreck, wheldon was behind the wheel of the new prototype car one meant to make his sport safer, and ideally no less exciting. the englishman had been outspoken for months about safety. indycar vice president will phillips said in an october story on indycar.com, the racing series official website, that wheldon had provided consistent and concise feedback in this effort. the crash that killed him raised even more questions, about safety in motor sports generally and at the las vegas track specifically. the 33 year old was among those driving at about 220 mph in tight quarters in the 34 vehicle field when several members of the pack spun out of control and burst into flames. two days later, indycar announced there would be an investigation. it is being done by the automobile competition committee of the united states and the federation internationale de lautomobile, the sports national and international governing bodies. the loop in las vegas is 1.5 miles, one mile shorter than the indianapolis motor speedway. it also is wider than many others such that more cars can run alongside and potentially collide with one another. after wheldons death, driver dario franchitti told abc news that the oval offered nowhere to get away from anybody. this is not a suitable track, and weve seen it today, he said.   \n",

began attending fight club like meetups in the bay area where enthusiasts pit the amateur flying machines against each other in bloodless battles of strength and flying technique. we were beginners, so just getting off the ground caused damage, cornblatt said of the dogfights, which were won by whichever drone lasted the longest and got back up in the air fastest. and so the idea for an indestructible drone design was born. cornblatt, along with eli delia, started game of drones. using an extremely durable plastic called kydex, the company creates inexpensive but rugged drones capable of surviving everything from high impact crashes to shotgun blasts. for many, the word drone still conjures images of military strikes or a near future retail fleet delivering packages or pizzas. but while commercial uses of unmanned aerial vehicles are banned while tangled up in federal regulations, a growing number of drone enthusiasts are embracing the still young technology as a creative new pursuit. the result is a lively community of hobbyists, entrepreneurs and aerial photographers, some of whom gathered this week for a picnic and flying demonstration in a suburban field south of napa. the drone fly in event was the brainchild of make magazine, which is celebrating a new all drone issue. the technology is still very much in the hands of the do it yourselfers and the enthusiasts, said mike senese, makes executive editor. rise of the diy drones . the maker movement, with its legions of tinkerers, is an ideal community to embrace drones. the diy drone technology has grown organically from existing popular maker interests, including micro controllers, robotics and radio controlled vehicles. drones combine all those disciplines to create advanced and programmable versions of what look like toy helicopters. the most practical and popular use for the devices is aerial photography. lightweight cameras like gopros can be affixed to drones such as the dji phantom quadcopter or the forthcoming 750 iris from 3d robotics. specialized drone rigs can even hold larger professional cameras. soaring up to several hundred feet above the ground produces some unbeatable angles. but to get a perfect shot, hobbyists program their drones with precise routes and mount the cameras on gimbals, which keep the camera steady and pointed in one direction even as the drone moves about. for us, drones means capable of autonomy, said chris anderson, founder of 3d robotics and the former editor of wired magazine. being able to program an exact path for a drone instead of manually steering it is what makes the technology so promising for commercial and photography use, enthusiasts say. experimenting and making . playing pilot is part of the fun for hobbyists. just as there are a variety of uses for drones, theres a number of ways to steer them. the more traditional controls are hand held joysticks and knobs. more advanced controlling can be done through computers and increasingly, tablets and smartphones, although some purists claim the touchscreens lack the tactile satisfaction of physical controls. a startup called fighting walrus is working on a 129 accessory that clips onto the end of an ipad and can be used to control standard, mid range drones over a radio connection. with the app, you can program a route and monitor the devices flight progress, though full manual controls are coming in a future update. the most immersive, and arguably most fun, way to pilot a drone is through first person view . a small camera is affixed to the front of the drone, and a person on the ground views a live stream from the drones point of view though a pair of goggles. users can control the drones direction in real time, which feels similar to piloting an aircraft from inside a cockpit. some enthusiasts even use fpv setups for drone races. many drones are square quadcopters and it can be difficult to tell which way theyre facing at any given time. the fpv live stream clears up any confusion, though sometimes its tricky to find a downed drone when you didnt see where it landed. flying under the radar . the federal aviation administration is expected to complete standards and rules for commercial drones by late 2015, though senators and lobbyists are pushing for an earlier deadline. until the faa clears drones for flight in general airspace, the devices are only allowed to be flown for recreation and below 400 feet. manufacturers of professional drones are stuck on the sidelines for the time being, but this has left the door open for hobbyists to experiment and invent. the consumer first approach might help pave the way for more widespread acceptance of commercial drones whenever they take to the air. some enterprising drone companies are already doing business while avoiding the glare of the faa. aerial drone photographers are selling their services to real estate companies and the movie and tv industry. journalists have used the devices to capture footage of news events. a handful of people have been sent cease and desist letters from the faa. because they can be outfitted with cameras, microphones and other surveillance equipment, drones will no doubt be used by law enforcement. but such drones will have to battle public privacy concerns in the u.s. people decide what theyre comfortable with, said anderson, who pointed out that it will continue to be illegal to fly drones over built up areas like housing or cities. play on . drones, called uavs by large companies and industry groups, are expected to be a 89 billion business worldwide in the next decade,according to the teal group. for example, agriculture will be a huge market for the devices, which could allow famers to monitor crops autonomously. for now, inventors and hobbyists are enjoying improving the technology while waiting for the commercial industry to catch up. photographers are skirting around regulations, companies are selling new commercial models in the u.s. and in countries with more relaxed regulations, and the game of drones guys are busy with their high tech endurance tests. i took out into the wasteland with a baseball bat and my anger, said cornblatt. ive wanted to destroy them but ive been unable to do so, so i decided to sell them.   \n",

        israels prime minister dismissed a recent white house rebuke of israeli settlement construction, saying in comments broadcast on sunday that the criticism goes against american values. the tough words by prime minister benjamin netanyahu threatened to deepen a rift with the white house over israeli construction in the west bank and east jerusalem, areas captured by israel in the 1967 mideast war and claimed by the palestinians as parts of a future independent state. israel came under fire last week after a jerusalem city official signed the final go ahead for construction of a new housing development in east jerusalem. scroll down for video . prime minister benjamin netanyahu blasted the white house, saying the obama administrations criticism of israeli settlements in israelis un american a day earlier, an ultranationalist jewish group said dozens of settlers would move into six apartment buildings purchased in the heart of a predominantly arab neighborhood of east jerusalem. israel says east jerusalem is part of its capital and considers jewish housing developments there to be neighborhoods of the city. but the international community, including the united states, does not recognize israels annexation of the area and considers construction there to be illegitimate settlement activity. in a striking public rebuke last week, the obama administration warned israel that the new project would distance israel from even its closest allies and raise questions about its commitment to seeking peace with palestinians. in an interview broadcast sunday on cbss face the nation, netanyahu said he does not accept restrictions on where jews could live, and said that jerusalems arabs and jews should be able to buy homes wherever they want. he said he was baffled by the american condemnation. its against the american values. and it doesnt bode well for peace, he said. the idea that wed have this ethnic purification as a condition for peace, i think its anti peace. the interview was recorded thursday. the white house declined comment. the united states and other allies do not recognize israels move into the west bank and east jerusalem, and consider

            "73831   a man who matches the description of lena dunhams alleged rapist has set up a legal fund to defend his reputation and prepare for a law suit against the girls creator, a report claims. ms dunham, 28, dedicates a chapter of her book, not that kind of girl, to a flamboyant republican conservative that she met at oberlin college in ohio identified as barry, who she claims raped her after a party. subsequent reports found a man named barry one fits the description. after numerous failed attempts to get ms dunham to remove the passage or openly clear his name, ones attorney aaron minc reveals a fund has been set up to gather costs to defend his reputation. scroll down for video . rape claims in her memoir not that kind of girl, lena dunham alleges she was raped in college. a new media investigation claims there is no proof of the man she describes . minc told breitbart all proceeds will be spent by barry on legal costs and related fees associated with defending barrys reputation including, but not limited to, potentially pursuing lena dunham and penguin random house for harm caused to barrys reputation from the publication and sale of ms dunhams memoir. in ms dunhams memoir for which she received a reported 3.7 million advance the writer claims she drank alcohol then took xanax and cocaine before inviting barry back to her on campus apartment. but the encounter, she claims, quickly turned aggressive, and barry twice removed the condom during intercourse without telling her. i never gave permission to be rough, to stick himself inside me without a barrier between us, she wrote. i never gave him permission. in my deepest self i know this, and the knowledge of it has kept me from sinking. dunhams description of barry is similarly explicit, explaining him as a mustachioed campus republican with a mustache that rode the line between ironic williamsburg fashion and big buck hunter, who hosted a radio show called real talk with jimbo, worked in the library stacking shelves and wore purple cowboy boots. she also said that he once punched a girl in the boob at a party and, following a consensual sexual encounter, another girl woke to find blood spattered all over the wall like a crime scene. scene it is believed the rape dunham describes in her book took place at oberlin college in ohio in the winter of 2005 following a party . furthermore dunham does not state that barry is a pseudonym, as she does with other names that appear in her book. although a breitbart investigation found the character to be a ghost, articles by the washington post and power line supported ones claim that he has a solid libel case against ms dunham. in a statement, barry ones attorney said he has already spent two months worth of legal fees defending himself. he has been in contact with ms dunhams team since october 6 but despite multiple requests, the statement says, lena dunham has not issued any sort of statement clearing barrys name and clarifying the confusion that is happening. any proceeds not used on legal related costs, minc said, will be donated to not for profit organizations that assist victims of rape and sexual assault, to be selected at a later date. an investigation by john nolte from breitbart news undertaken at the oberlin campus, which was published thursday, concluded that the barry dunham describes is a ghost, and that no such person appeared to exist at the college during the years she studied there. in fact, we could not find anyone who remembered any oberlin republican who matched dunhams colorful description, nolte wrote. under scrutiny, dunhams rape story didnt just fall apart, it evaporated into pixie dust and blew away. the breitbart report followed an attack on dunham by the national reviews hard right columnist kevin williamson, who said she was grossly irresponsible for publishing the rape claim in the first place. williamson said he spoke to a barry who was a prominent republican that attended oberlin and that has been hounded by the media since the release of not that kind of girl in september. this barry told williamson he has never met dunham and did not have any kind of relationship with her. he said the fact his name is barry and that he is a republican who went to oberlin is the most unfortunate coincidence of my life. the man, who is married with kids, said he is petrified that his full name is going to be published. williamson then wrote of dunham it is at the very least the deployment of weaponized celebrity without any concern for collateral damage. i have my doubts about whether the encounter dunham describes actually happened at all in her memoir, she writes about presenting anecdotes from other peoples lives as her own. but, for the record, the man to whom i spoke does not believe that dunham intended to refer to him. the breitbart investigation, which describes dunham as one of the most powerful and influential women in america, included the account of williamsons barry. it notes that friends of his laughed at the suggestion of him ever having a moustache and that other details given by dunham also didnt fit. nolte then goes in search of someone else that might fit the description. he deduces the alleged rape occurred in winter 2005. massive publicity tour lena dunham meets fans and signs copies of her book not that kind of girl at waterstones in london on october 29, 2014 . a search of the campus newspaper archives and oberlin college graduation announcements did not find any barry other than the one williamson spoke to who graduated or attended oberlin college in 2005, 2006, or 2007. a further search of the campus for someone not named barry but who fits the description given by dunham also showed no results. there was no proof of a radio show called real talk with jimbo, he said. nevertheless, no amount of digging could verify even a single detail of dunhams rape claim, nolte wrote. the report criticizes dunham for pointing the finger at this one barry in such a public manner, as opposed to reporting what happened to her to the authorities. dunham has not responded to the brietbart news piece. calls to random house, the publisher of not that kind of girl, and to dunhams literary agent made by mailonline were not immediately returned on thursday. dunham did however react to williamson when his piece was published last month. she took to twitter to defend her story. love dunham is seen here at the 2014 golden globes with her boyfriend, musician jack antonoff . some men are enraged by stories of sexual assault that dont have clear cut villains, pimps or men with guns, she wrote. thats because these stories force them to ask hard questions about their history with consent. well, we all have to ask hard questions. grow the f up. and i have some news for certain news outlets. no matter how much you thump your keyboards with your meat hands we will not stop talking. this is not the only controversy to come from dunhams tome. the new york native cancelled several appearances on her book tour after being accused of molesting her younger sister as a child. in one chapter of the book she describes how, as a seven year old, she experimented with her sister grace, who was one at the time. one day, as i sat in our driveway in long island playing blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the better of me, dunham wrote. grace was sitting up, babbling smiling, and i leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. the accusations were mostly spearheaded by williamson, who said her behavior was child abuse. dunham came back swinging, writing on twitter the right wing news story that i molested my little sister isnt just lol its really f ing upsetting and disgusting. family dunham was accused of molesting her younger sister grace by two media outlets following a controversial chapter in her book, where she admits to experiment with her sibling as a child . and by the way, if you were a little kid and never looked at another little kids vagina, well, congrats to you. usually this is stuff i can ignore but dont demean sufferers, dont twist my words, . i told a story about being a weird 7 year old. i bet you have some too, old men, that id rather not hear. and yes, this is a rage spiral.   \n",

with security forces in indian administered kashmir, police said. kashmiri villagers pray during the funeral of mohammed haneef, a hizbul mujahedeen commander, sunday. the clashes, which culminated with their deaths on sunday, followed five days of heavy snowfall across kashmir that claimed 19 lives, 10 of them on friday alone. late saturday indian army and paramilitary forces engaged a group of militants hiding in south kashmir, noorpora village, 45 kilometers from the capital of srinagar, a police spokesman said. he identified them as belonging to hizbul mujahedeen, comprising mostly local militants. as refused to lay down their weapons, a sustained encounter resulted, which continued for several hours, the spokesman said. a militant commander and the financial chief of the group were among the dead, he said. a top commander of pakistan based harkatul mujahedeen was killed in a separate north kashmir encounter between militants and indian security forces, the spokesman said. indian security forces have recently intensified their operations against militants. in the past 15 days, nearly 20 militants have been killed across indian administered kashmir in gunfights. kashmir has long been an object of dispute between nuclear rivals and neighbors india and pakistan, and militants fighting for kashmirs separation from india have been carrying out attacks against the indian security forces in kashmir for 19 years. the separatist violence has left 42,000 people dead, officials said. however, rights groups and various non governmental organizations put the number at twice

assisted suicide died wednesday, his family said. tony nicklinson, 58, had been refusing food since last week, contracted pneumonia over the weekend, and went downhill rapidly, said his lawyer, saimo chahal. before he died, he asked us to tweet goodbye world the time has come, i had some fun, his twitter account said. the former rugby player was left paralyzed from the neck down by a catastrophic stroke seven years ago, and lost a high court battle last week to gain a legal right to end his life when he chose. the fight seemed to go out of him after the courts decision, leaving him heartbroken, chahal said after his death was announced. his wife, sister and daughters were with him when he died, she said. he was gutsy, determined and a fighter to the end, said chahal, adding it had been an absolute privilege to represent him. his legal case will not continue unless someone in similar circumstances steps forward to pursue it, she said. police in the county of wiltshire, where he lived, said that a doctor had been seeing nicklinson over the past week, and that they were not investigating the death. his condition meant it was impossible for him to take his own life, and he wanted the legal right to have a doctor take his life without fear of prosecution. most of my body is paralyzed, but my mind is as it was before the stroke. all i can move is my head, and the stroke took away my power of speech. now i talk to people with a perspex spelling board or a computer operated by my eye blinks, he told cnn in an interview in june. while expressing sympathy for his situation, the high court ruled august 16 that such a significant change to the law involving overturning the ban on voluntary euthanasia would have to be decided by lawmakers. the judges also rejected a similar challenge to the law brought by a second man suffering from locked in syndrome, named only as martin. psychiatrist i hate suicide but also understand it . the cases raise profoundly difficult ethical, social and legal issues, but judged that any change to the law must be a matter for parliament to decide, a statement from the court said. the ruling upset nicklinson, who cried as his wife, jane, told the waiting media that the family was bitterly disappointed and would file an appeal. all too often, well meaning able bodied people just assume that if a person is so severely disabled that he needs assistance to commit suicide, he must automatically be unable to deal with such choice, he said in june. i say that where a person has the mental ability, he should have the choice of his own life or death. the only difference between you and me is my inability to take my own life, he said. in a statement given via his computer last week after the decision, nicklinson said its not the result i was hoping for but it isnt entirely unexpected. judges, like politicians, are happiest when they can avoid confronting the real issues and this judgment is not an exception to the rule. i believe the legal team acting on my behalf is prepared to go all the way with this, but unfortunately for me it means yet another period of physical discomfort, misery and mental anguish while we find out who controls my life me or the state. his daughters, tweeting on his behalf, urged people to sign a petition via his twitter account supporting his right to die with dignity. within hours, thousands of people had added their names. jane nicklinson said the family did not intend to go to switzerland, which has an assisted suicide law, because it was expensive and her husband did not think he should have to go overseas to die. before his stroke at age 51, the couple lived a comfortable life in the united arab emirates and traveled extensively. speaking to cnn in june, jane nicklinson described her husband before the stroke as a man who was the life and soul of the party, making his current severely restricted existence even harder to bear. he was a big bloke, ex rugby player, he worked hard but he played hard, she said. he was full of life, great sense of humor, loved the sound of his own voice. cnns laura smith spark, sarah chiplin, jo shelley, atika

proposal of new rules that could let internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users. the controversial fast lane rules has received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online, along with open internet advocates. outside the hearing protesters banged drums and held up signs calling for net neutrality, while at least one was ushered out of the hearing after standing up and yelling at the commissioners. scroll down for video . federal communications commission chairman tom wheeler the fcc has voted in favor of a proposal to reform net neutrality and could allow internet service providers to charge for faster and higher quality service. under the plans for priority usage, netflix would pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers, and maintain and improve streaming quality and reliability. this is being heavily criticised by net neutrality campaigners. at the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same, regardless of size or destination. all this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment. although it seems like a fair model, in which sites that use the most bandwith pay the most money, campaigners claim it will drastically impact on industry competition. for example, netflix has the money to pay for better service, using the fast lanes, while smaller companies dont. this means smaller companies may have the same range of content, but because they cant stream at the same quality, they are effectively priced out of the market. to address these claims, the new rules include a competition test. isps would need to decide if a website meets the critieria to be given priority access and that this bar must be set high enough to protect competition. the preliminary vote, in which three of agencys commissioners supported the measure and two dissented, moves the so called net neutrality rules into a formal public comment period. after the 120 day period ends, the fcc will revise the proposal and vote on a final set of rules. fcc chairman tom wheeler has said he wants the rules in place by the end of this year. today we take another step in what has been a decade long effort to protect a free and open internet, wheeler, a democrat, said before the vote. under the plans for priority usage, netflix would pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers, and maintain and improve streaming quality and reliability. but the idea of allowing priority access, even if its regulated by the government, has received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online, along with open internet advocates. outside the hearing protesters banged drums and held up signs calling for net neutrality. at least one was ushered out of the hearing after standing up and yelling at the commissioners. commissioner michael orielly, who voted no, called the proposed rules a regulatory boondoggle, arguing that supporters of the rules havent shown they will help consumers. and commissioner ajit pai, who also voted no, said the issue would be better decided by congress than by five unelected officials. but since the issue has fallen on the commission, he argued that a group of economists from across the country should do peer reviewed studies and host a series of public hearings to hammer out their differences before a decision is made. in short, getting the future of the internet right is more important than getting this done right now, pai said. tighe barry of codepink , along with other demonstrators, protest outside the federal communications commission . at least one was ushered out of the hearing after standing up and yelling at the commissioners. a previous set of rules from 2010 was struck down by an appeals court in january after verizon challenged them. the fcc says the rules currently proposed follow the blueprint set forth by that court decision. in addition, the commission will consider the possibility of defining internet service providers as common carriers, like telephone companies, which are subject to greater regulation than internet providers, under title ii of the communications act of 1934. the fcc and wheeler have so far avoided subjecting cable and telecoms companies to title ii treatment, although wheeler has said the option remains on the table. netflix has found success with original . content including house of cards and orange is the new black, as well as . the streaming of other tv shows and films. to stream these shows, it uses a large amount of bandwith much more than standard text and videos on webpages, for example. under the plans for priority lanes, netflix would pay extra to use these lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers, and maintain or improve the streaming quality and reliability. earlier this month netflix raised its prices in europe, the uk and the u.s by 1, 1 and 1 respectively. customers of netflix, which has produced shows including house of cards , could be charged more to stream programmes if the website chooses to pay more for a better service . this price rise applies to new customers only, while existing customers will remain on the old price for two years. fcc chairman tom wheeler has broadened the scope of his proposed open internet rules and suggested tougher standards for internet providers who wish to create paid priority fast lanes on their networks. according to an fcc official, wheeler made revisions after the commission received 35,000 public comments many of them expressing outrage. wheeler, a democrat, also tweaked his proposal after the commissions two other democrats expressed concern. the new draft clearly reflects public input the commission has received, the fcc official said in a statement. the draft is explicit that the goal is to find the best approach to ensure the internet remains open and prevent any practices that threaten it. netflix, which has also released orange is the new black, could be made to pay more to use priority fast lanes on isp networks . among the additions is a provision that would presume it to be illegal for an internet provider to prioritise the traffic of an affiliated service for example, it would be considered illegal if comcast tried to give faster treatment to video streams of its subsidiary network, nbc. however, an internet service provider would be allowed to challenge that presumption, the official said. in the revised proposal, wheeler also seeks comment on the possibility of treating broadband providers as so called common carriers like telephone companies, which are subject to greater regulation than internet providers, under title ii of the communications act of 1934. the fcc and wheeler have so far avoided subjecting cable and telecoms companies to title ii treatment, although wheeler has said the option remains on the table. in the new proposal, he entertains more discussion on it than his initial proposal did. fcc chairman tom wheeler has broadened the scope of his proposed open internet rules and suggested tougher standards for internet providers who wish to create paid priority fast lanes on their networks . the proposal also asks whether all paid priority fast lanes should be banned outright. the previous version only asks if some paid priority services should be banned. wheeler has faced a torrent of criticism after the earlier proposal made it appear as if he was overhauling the principle of net neutrality, which says internet service providers should not be allowed to discriminate against web traffic depending on its source. such discrimination could result if a phone company like att slowed down traffic from phone services like skype, or if comcast slowed netflix video speeds to favour its own online video service, xfinity. an earlier set of rules from 2010 was struck down by an appeals court in january after verizon challenged them.   \n",

undocumented workers, a plan he said would improve the safety and security of the people of my state. new york gov. eliot spitzer says wednesday in washington that opposition to his plan doomed it. spitzer said he was giving up because he had concluded that new york state cannot successfully address this problem on its own. he said he wanted to act because of the failure of the federal government to deal with immigration policy and the impact that failure was having on new york. i would suggest to you what everyone already knows, spitzer said. the federal government has lost control of its borders. it has allowed millions of undocumented workers to enter our country and now has no solution to deal with them. the effect was about 1 million undocumented workers in new york state, many of whom are driving without licenses, said spitzer, surrounded at a news conference by members of his states congressional delegation. watch spitzer explain why hes withdrawing the proposal . spitzer said licensing workers who did not have social security numbers, which new york had done in the past, would have aided law enforcement and would have made the states streets safer and more secure. however, spitzer acknowledged that you dont need a stethoscope to hear the heartbeat of the public, saying he had concluded that opposition to his plan would have doomed it. you have polarization on this issue that has defied resolution, he said. watch what a hornets nest the proposal stirred up . spitzer put forward his proposal in september, saying it would bring new yorks estimated 1 million illegal immigrants out of the shadows. in october, the governor said there would be three tiers of licenses, ranging from a license restricting travel, a document called real id for legal residents and a stricter one that would allow people to travel into canada. u.s. rep. charles rangel, d new york, on wednesday thanked spitzer for making the effort to bring about change, noting that undocumented workers are part of the economy, they are part of what americas supposed to be. there is no question that we lack the leadership on the national level to change the tone, rangel said. and that is the reason why leaders all over the country mayors and governors are trying so desperately hard to deal locally with a problem that is basically a national problem. one influential member of new yorks congressional delegation missing from the briefing was sen. hillary clinton, considered the front runner in the race for the democratic presidential nomination. a spokesman from her office said she couldnt attend the news conference because of a scheduling conflict. as the plan became a topic of national discussion, critics accused her of failing to take a definitive stance on the issue. in a debate last week, clinton said spitzers plan makes a lot of sense but stopped short of endorsing it. on wednesday, clinton issued a written statement supporting spitzers decision to withdraw the proposal. his difficult job is made that much harder by the failure of the congress and the white house to pass comprehensive immigration reform, clinton said. as president, i will not support drivers licenses for undocumented people and will press for comprehensive immigration reform that deals with all of the issues around illegal immigration, including border security and fixing our broken system. clintons rivals quickly pounced on her statement. a spokeswoman for sen. chris dodd, d connecticut, called her action flip flopping cubed, and bill burton, a spokesman for sen. barack obama, d illinois, also sharply criticized clinton for switching her views on the issue. when it takes two weeks and six different positions to answer one question on immigration, its easier to understand why the clinton campaign would rather plant their questions than answer them, burton said. seventy six percent of americans oppose giving drivers licenses to illegal immigrants, according to a poll conducted in october for cnn by the opinion research corp. members of the new york state sheriffs association voted in october to oppose spitzers proposal. i believe this is just a fundamental issue of right and wrong, said rep. tom latham, an iowa republican against spitzers plan. and to give people official recognition when they come in and break the law in their first act in this country is simply wrong. e mail to a friend . cnns alexis ginsberg contributed to this report.   \n",

                                 the husband it boss peter mason is alleged to have stabbed his wife and her lover . a millionaire who killed himself in prison after trying to murder his estranged wife and her lover co ordinated a sinister plan from behind bars to stop her getting her hands on his money. as his dying wish, computer boss peter mason had his bank account emptied and arranged for his two country mansions to be stripped of their luxury furnishings so that his wife, debbie, would be left with nothing. mrs mason, who has two young children and is still undergoing hospital treatment for severe stab injuries, has now spoken to police after she tried to access their shared funds and was distraught to discover everything was gone. a will mason wrote last may, which handed all of his money to their children emelia, 11, and dylan, seven, is also said to have been hidden. mason, 58, earned 200,000 a year as an account director at hewlett packard and previously worked for royal mail and the nhs. he was found dead in his cell on january 19 as he awaited trial for the attempted murder of his 45 year old wife and michael longden, a childhood sweetheart she had got back in touch with via friends reunited. he was accused of stabbing them in a frenzied attack last july after she fled the 500,000 family home in tuxford, nottinghamshire, with the children to start a new life with her lover. while on remand in prison following the attack, mason is said to have orchestrated a pyrrhic victory over his wife, confiding in a fellow prisoner that he wanted to make sure she could not access the wealth he had earned as a successful it boss. mason slipped two notes under his new friends cell door, one containing his online banking details and another authorising the man to enter his two homes and remove any of my personal items on my behalf as soon as he had served his sentence. these valuables are said to have included a rare stamp collection, antique william beilby wine glasses, paintings, furniture and tortoise shell tea caddies. mrs mason recently attempted to access the bank account but thousands of pounds had been taken, leaving it completely empty. electrical goods had also been bought using the money, including an ipad. she reported what had happened to police who had investigated the july attack, but is said to be frustrated that nothing has been done to get the money back. the family suspects mason also had money hidden in other accounts which his former wife cannot access. lovers debbie mason and michael longden had dated at sixth form college in herefordshire . andrea mcconchie, mrs masons sister, said sizeable amounts of money had been removed. we know bank accounts have been accessed, she said. they have bought electrical goods, an ipad, spending several hundreds of pounds in each case. they have emptied his bank account. great lengths were taken to try to deceive my sister and her lawyers. there are large amounts of money in other accounts but we dont know where they are. we want that money to be able to provide long term for the children. her priority is the children now. she just wants to put this behind her. it has been a tough year. a friend of the prisoner who was handed the bank details by mason said he had since visited the homes and tried to access the account. he said to him my wife is going to divorce me. shes going to take all my money. she had an affair, he added. he said he wanted him to have everything, to do whatever he wants with it. he said i just dont want my wife getting anything. mason was found hanged in his cell next to a picture of his children and a goodbye note. he was due to stand trial this month charged with two counts of attempted murder. at an earlier hearing, magistrates heard how his marriage ended in january last year when his wife left with the children to live with mr longden in ledbury, herefordshire. scene peter mason is alleged to have travelled to the new home of his estranged wife debbie where he stabbed her and her lover michael longden . the lovers had previously dated at sixth form college. in july, mason travelled to ledbury to meet his wife of ten years in a pub to discuss financial matters and the sale of their homes. peter mason was found dead in his cell as he awaited trial for the attempted murder of his wife and her lover . after she left, he allegedly followed her to her new cottage and stabbed her and her new partner multiple times. mason then tried to flee the scene in his car and hit a motorcyclist, who was uninjured, before being arrested. mrs mason suffered a punctured lung and serious injuries to one of her hands. her new partner also sustained serious stab injuries to his body, head and back. friends of mason, who was married twice previously, said he had become obsessed with his wife not receiving his money after she left him. a former business partner, who asked not to be named, said there had been a lot of wild talk. he felt his entire life had been taken away from him and she had left him with nothing. he was very much against giving debbie any kind of financial support. he was determined he wasnt going to give her any money. he had put the house on the market but had stopped doing the gardening because he said he couldnt be bothered any more. i think it was his intention to let it be repossessed. he would rather pull the house down and destroy it than give her anything. it was like he was harming himself in order to harm her. he wanted to create a kind of pyrrhic victory. masons sister adele, a dressage trainer, said hes not got the chance and i am not him. it is just very mixed feelings. while mrs masons family insists she has spoken to officers about the money being taken from the account, a spokesman for west mercia police said the force had not yet received any official reports.   \n",

black. numéro magazine chose to use blonde haired, blue eyed industry darling ondria hardin, 16, for the shoot which features in the march issue despite then making her up as a black model. the .

photographic creations, which insist on the melting pot and the mix of cultures, the exact opposite of any skin color based discrimination. numéro has always supported the artistic freedom of the talented photographers who work with the magazine to illustrate its pages, and has not took part in the creation process of this editorial. for its part, numéro magazine, which has the utmost respect for this photographers creative work, firmly excludes that the latest may have had, at any moment, the intention to hurt readers sensitivity, whatever their origin. numéro magazine considers that it has regularly demonstrated its deep attachment to the promotion of different skin colored models. for instance, the next issue of numéro for man on sale on 15th march has the black model fernando cabral on the cover page, and the current russian editions cover of our magazine features the black model naomi campbell on its cover. this demonstrates the completely inappropriate nature of the accusations made against our magazine, deeply committed to the respect for differences, tolerance and more generally to non discrimination. considering the turmoil caused by this publication, the

abatement. carbon trading is said to be one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. there, prime minister kevin rudd is looking to introduce a mandatory carbon trading system by 2010 which will cap the amount of pollution industry can release. the proposed australian system will be similar to the european union emission trading system which was established in 2005. with phase 1 of the european system complete, there are a few lessons about carbon trading that australia and other countries looking to go down this path could benefit from. so what is carbon trading carbon trading also known as cap and trade is a system designed to cut the carbon emissions which contribute to global warming. generally in a market based cap and trade system, a central authority such as a government or international body sets a limit on the amount of carbon which can be emitted and then divides this amount into units which are allocated to different groups. these units can then be traded as any commodity would. carbon trading can occur both between countries and amongst industries within countries. a second approach to carbon trading involves a country or business generating carbon credits by investing in green projects usually in developing countries that are said to reduce emissions. why is it necessary according to the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change there is unequivocal evidence that human activities have contributed to a gradual warming of the planet which has resulted in a change in climate. the ipcc report provides scientific evidence of change including to the duration of seasons, rainfall patterns and an increased frequency of extreme weather events. industrialization is recognized as a key factor in the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and according to the ipcc the world has warmed by an average of 0.74c in the past 100 years. the ipcc predicts that if ghg emissions continue to rise at their current rate, this century will see a further 3c rise in the average world temperature. while the consensus of the scientific community is that action must be taken to avert the worst impacts of climate change, economic arguments about the cost of climate change abatement advanced by countries like the u.s. and at one time australia have in the past proved an impediment to action. a carbon trading system is said to be one way that countries can look to make greenhouse gas emissions cuts with minimal economic impact. do you think carbon trading is the way to reduce greenhouse emissions what trading systems exist established in 2005, the european union emissions trading scheme is the largest multi national, multi sector co2 trading system in the world. the ultimate aim of the system is to ensure that eu member states are compliant with their kyoto protocol commitments and to do this the most energy intensive industries are allocated carbon permits by member states which allow them to emit a certain amount of co2. if these companies want to emit more co2 than their permits allow for, they are able to buy them from more efficient companies with spare permits. the eu ets takes in around 12,000 installations which account for around 50 percent of eu greenhouse gas emissions from industries such as power, steel and cement manufacture. according the world bank, the eu ets contributed 50 billion of the 64 billion traded in the carbon market in 2007. the second largest carbon trading system exists under the united nations kyoto protocol. the protocol which sets binding emission targets for 37 industrialized countries permits emissions trading in order to help countries meet their agreed upon targets. countries have agreed to an average 5 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions, compared to 1990 levels, by 2012 and carbon trading is one way to meet this quota. by december 2008, the eu ets will link up with the un trading system to create a more global scheme. the clean development mechanism is a further carbon trading mechanism of the protocol which allows industrialized nations to claim emission credits from investment in clean technologies which will offset carbon in developing countries. developed nations can also finance emission reduction projects in developing countries through joint implementation in exchange for emission credits. new zealand has established a mandatory carbon trading system this year and australia has also committed to expanding the pioneering new south wales greenhouse gas reduction scheme to a national market by 2010. new mandatory systems are being considered for japan and canada. voluntary carbon markets also exist, with the chicago climate exchange one of the more established ones. what do permits cost the cost of a carbon permit is dictated by the market forces of supply and demand. in 2007, one european union allocation was trading at 30 to 35. what industries are subject to trading under mandatory schemes like the eu ets, its the most energy intensive industries within member states which are subject to carbon trading. this includes industries like power installations, steel and cement manufacture and the construction industry. the commercial aviation industry which accounts for 3 percent of eu emissions could be brought into the eu ets by 2011. currently personal or household emissions and the public sector and transport industry emissions are not included in any carbon trading system. has emissions trading been successful yes and no. the introduction of mandatory systems which cap emissions like the eu ets is a step in the right direction for trying to cut emissions without a major cost to business. however, critics such as carbon trade watch argue that the current carbon trade systems are flawed because there is a tendency for the biggest polluters to be over allocated permits. this was clearly evident with phase 1 of the eu ets when the market virtually collapsed in 2006 because too many allowances were allocated. market analyst franck schuttellaar estimated that the united kingdoms most polluting companies made windfall profits of around 1.7 billion as a direct result of generous carbon credit allocation under the eu ets. questions have also been raised about whether carbon trading systems actually reduce ghg emissions. independent uk think tank open europe reported that between 2005 and 2006 emissions from industries covered by the ets actually rose in uk by 3.6 percent and by 0.8 percent across the whole of europe. auctioning off carbon credits at the outset rather that simply allocating credits to business for free is one way that has been proposed to help the system make a real impact on emissions. certainly, increasing the scarcity of carbon credits would help ensure that businesses commit to genuine low carbon alternatives. while carbon emissions account for around 70 percent of greenhouse gases, they are not the sole cause of climate change and it would seem a safer bet to reinforce a carbon trading system with other legislative measures aimed at reducing emissions.   \n",

the website is now under complete control of two allies close to president vladimir putin. pavel durov, dubbed the russian mark zuckerberg, was head of vkontakte, the countrys version of facebook. but announcing his dismissal on his vkontakte page yesterday, mr durov said the social network will now fall under state control and claims he only read about his sacking through reading it in the press. pavel durov, the founder of russian social network vkontakte, who claims he has been fired by allies close to president putin . in a statement he said i was fired as general director of vkontakte. its interesting that the shareholders didnt have the bravery to do this directly, and that i learned about my firing from the press. he added in this way, today vkontakte goes under the complete control of igor sechin and alisher usmanov. probably, in the russian context, something like this was inevitable, but im happy we lasted seven and a half years. we did a lot. and part of whats been done cant be turned back. igor sechin, left and alisher usmanov, right, are now in control of russian social network vkontakte . the homepage of vkontakte, a russian version of facebook, which was founded by mr durov . the 29 year old, is said to have refused previous attempts to censor vkontakte and has largely remained out of politics. he is thought to have refused to shut down groups on the site, which were related to opposition leader alexey navalny and to anti government protests in ukraine . it was rumoured last year that mr durov was to leave the firm, and sell his stake in vkontakte, which boasts over 100 million users. in january, he announced he had sold his 12 per cent stake in the firm and on april 1, he appeared to reveal that he was quitting the network. the two men now controlling vkontakte are thought to be close allies of russian president vladimir putin . but just two days later, he posted on vkontakte that he had had withdrawn his resignation, implying that it was an april fools day joke. yesterday, the russian news agency interfax quoted the vkontakte press service as saying mr durov tendered his resignation on march 21, and never officially withdrew it. they added that as a month had passed, his resignation has now come into effect. the network is now under control of igor sechin and alisher usmanov, both close allies to president putin. mr sechin is said to be one of mr putins closest advisors and is the chief executive of state owned oil company rosneft. he also served as deputy prime minister of russia in mr putins cabinet from from 2008 until 2012. mr usmanov, ranked russias richest man, is a metals tycoon who expanded into technology and owned a 10 per cent stake in facebook. he has been steadily upping his stake in vkontakte recently and is also a major shareholder in arsenal football club.   \n",

picking up sizable speaking fees and addressing audiences who cheer any mention of her future plans. and nearly every analyst has her as the likely democratic nominee next time around, should she run. while clintons closest advisers are trying to keep supporters from anointing her the inevitable nominee for fear it will create a backlash among grassroots voters they are losing that fight in part because some americans, especially democrats, want to be a part of history. a gallup poll friday showed that 18 of americans surveyed said clinton becoming the first woman president would be the best or most positive thing about her winning the election. it was cited by 30 of democrats and 17 of independents. breaking the glass ceiling . potent is an understatement. is there a word stronger than potent said dan mahaffee, the director of policy at the center for the study of the presidency and congress, when asked about the potential impact on the electorate of clinton becoming the first woman president. there certainly is that dynamic for there to be a historical president, to feel part of that is certainly a strong driver, he said. when barack obama ran for president defeating clinton for the democratic nomination a strong, but far from the only aspect of his draw was the history of electing the first black president. a similar case could be made for clinton, who regularly talks about women getting into politics and the importance of electing the right first woman to the white house. nathan gonzales, deputy editor of the rothenberg political report, echoed mahaffee, saying people want to be a part of history even though some would like to believe that elections are driven by issues and differences between candidates. gonzales said electing a woman would crash through another glass ceiling. i think voters could be driven by this sense of history, he said. finding that clinton becoming the first woman president would be the best thing about her winning in 2016, the survey also found that number outpaced all other factors in the open ended question. nine percent of people said her experience would be the best, while 3 said her competence, 2 said her intelligence and 2 said the fact that bill clinton would be back in the white house. from the american publics perspective, hillary clintons greatest selling point going into the 2016 presidential election, should she decide to run, would be the historic fact that, if elected, she would be the first female president in the nations history, wrote frank newport, editor in chief of gallup. clinton not helping inevitability fight . for her part, clinton has fed this inevitability. the former senator made it clear when she halted her 2008 primary campaign she was proud of the about 18 million cracks the number of people who voted for her that her campaign put into the glass ceiling of electing a women president. clinton proclaimed that the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time. those comments are put into a different context considering clinton is actively mulling another run at breaking that ceiling. female participation in politics and business has become a part of nearly every speech clinton delivers. in florida, she talked about the importance of women in leadership positions in vancouver, she looked to inspire women to get involved and participate, and tuesday in montreal, the former first lady talked about the benefits of having more women in politics. having people get out of their comfort zones and think about being somebodys shoes or high heels as the case may be, gives you a broader view, she said, adding that more women in politics is better for the united states political system. i believe that there can be and hopefully will be differences by having more women in these positions, clinton said, noting that of course it depends on who the women are. clinton told the audience that while she hadnt yet made up her mind on 2016, she has a deep sense of commitment to my country and its future. not just about being a woman . for marcy stech, spokeswoman for emilys list, the historic factor of a possible clinton presidency is obviously a draw to democratic voters. we see right now that there is an overwhelming excitement in battleground states to elect the first woman president, said stech, whose group runs madam president, a program to elect a woman president. there is a clear desire among democrats to break that glass ceiling. but to stech and others clintons inevitability is more than just americans looking to elect a woman. we know that voters dont support women candidates just because they are women, stech said. instead, she added that voters tend to see women as more focused on problem solving and more likely to work with people who they may disagree with. mahaffee agrees with stech. there is such a talent and resume gap between her and everyone else that is even potentially being floated and it is even shocking to think that one of those people is the sitting vice president, added the historian. even according clinton, electing a woman just because she is a woman is not the right way to vote. when asked during a question and answer session of an appearance at ucla whether it was important for the united states to elect a female president, clinton quickly and bluntly said, well, the right female president, yes.   \n",

have the company considering a trip to bankruptcy court, possibly as early as thursday. it doesnt necessarily signal the end of this faux roman empire, though. if all goes according to the companys plan, drawn up with its most senior creditors, it should be business as usual for customers its doors will remain open. caesars palace hotel and casino, in las vegas is pictured, as they try and find a way of cutting debt . caesars is, in a certain sense, a nevada version of too big to fail, said michael green, a history professor with the university of nevada, las vegas. u.s. casino hotel companies are dependent on extra cash in a persons pocket, but perhaps none more than caesars, which waded into the recent economic downturn already burdened by more debt than any of them a by product of a buyout in january 2008 that was largely a wager using other peoples money. while competitors found fortune in asias casino growth as stateside gambling in las vegas and atlantic city waned, caesars missed out. and as other companies built arenas and shopping districts on the strip or casino hotels in newer gambling markets across the country, analysts say caesars was reluctant to spend. it went private, then public again to raise cash and created new related companies, shifting its properties from one to another to free them up from the debt cordoned off in one spot, its caesars entertainment operating co. thats the company now headed to bankruptcy court. regardless of the maneuvers, the fundamentals were not there to support the amount of debt that they had, said keith foley, an analyst with moodys investors service. apollo global management llc and tpg capital lp did what a lot of private equity firms were doing at the time when money and loans were easy to come by, buying companies with promise relying mostly on debt to add to its portfolio. the gambling industry looked promising. the deal to buy caesars was first announced in 2006 during the heyday of vegas tourism and development. but the deal didnt close until january 2008, several months before lehman brothers would go bankrupt, shaking the economy to its core. and it was a nearly 30 billion deal with the two firms taking on more than 10 billion of existing debt and relying on several billion more in bonds to pay for the company. the fountain in front of caesars palace hotel and casino in las vegas is part of the groups lavish design . in between, the company had cut about 200 people from its corporate staff. before the year was done, caesars was cutting more staff and looking for new cash to make its interest payments. among its casino peers, caesars empire remains the largest, employing some 68,000 people worldwide at more than 50 casino hotels, including caesars palace on the las vegas strip. while caesars entertainment has seen a steady 8.6 billion or so in revenue since 2009, its been outpaced by las vegas sands corp., which went all in in macau, china, and grew every year to post revenue of 14.5 billion in 2013. las vegas sands made a 2.3 billion profit that year. caesars lost 2.9 billion. caesars has lost money each year for the last five years. still, the company unveiled its high roller observation wheel and newly renovated hotels on the strip the linq and the cromwell. it hired headliners for shows at the colosseum inside caesars palace. all the while, it was shifting and shuttering other assets. last year, the company closed properties in atlantic city, london and mississippi and said it would cut its global workforce by less than 1 percent. theyre going to have to become a little leaner, said chris jones, an analyst for union gaming group. he added that he doesnt expect any more properties to shut down and expects the plan will free up caesars to reinvest where it hasnt, including the gambling floor. the company faces irked creditors, a few who have tried to force the casino giant into bankruptcy against its will this week. others have sued, claiming the company ransacked caesars entertainment operating co. of most of its valuable assets. caesars called the claims meritless and alleges some of its holdout creditors are hoping for the companys demise in order to win wagers predicting as much. despite the acrimony, the company says that after months of negotiations it has more than 60 percent of the holders of its first priority debt on board with its plan. the plan would shed 10 billion in debt from its weighed down operations division, leaving it with 8.6 billion and winnowing its annual 1.7 billion in interest payments to 450 million. senior creditors who okd the plan would get cash and new debt to make them whole.   \n",

                                                                                                                 by . tamara cohen . school milk must be offered to all pupils from the new year, it emerged last night. officials believe it forms a key part of a healthy diet. they also hope the measure will slash pupils consumption of fruit juices, with their high sugar content. the change comes in new school food standards released today. the overhaul of school meals was announced as deputy prime minister nick clegg was joined by tv chef lorraine pascale at foresters primary school in london . under then changes, pupils will be offered three types of fruit a week, but fruit juice will be limited . they will specify that semi skimmed milk must be available for drinking at least once a day in all primary and secondary institutions. however, it will not be free for all. reinstating the place of milk in daily school life is a remarkable turnaround for the conservatives. it has been an emotive issue for the party since the then education secretary margaret thatcher was nicknamed the milk snatcher in 1971 for scrapping the free drink for the over sevens. four years ago david cameron had to stop his higher education ministers plans to axe it for under fives to cut costs. the food standards to be unveiled by education secretary michael gove today aim to clamp down on sugary and fried products. the milk will also help address concerns about low calcium levels in children. currently, schools are only encouraged to offer healthy drinks to pupils and many do not offer milk at all. milk must be offered to all schoolchildren under the new food standards . obesity campaigners welcomed the measure but said they would have gone further in trying to cut juice consumption. the under fives will continue to get their milk for nothing but older pupils will be charged, except for those on free school meals but it is hoped making small cartons available will encourage more pupils to make a habit of drinking it. a department for education source said this is new. we hope making low fat milk regularly available at least once a day will help encourage children to have healthier diets. the return of milk follows a review of school dinners by restaurateurs henry dimbleby and john vincent. that came after the high profile campaign begun by jamie oliver in 2005 to improve pupils food. they concede meals have improved dramatically over the years since the celebrity chefs crusade against fast food horrors such as turkey twizzlers which were later banned. but officials say the guidelines brought in by new labour which forced schools to submit meal plans and samples to a laboratory to check their nutritional content were too complex and bureaucratic. under the guidelines, fruit juice will be restricted to one 150ml glass per day from january amid growing evidence of the damaging effect of its rich natural sugars on childrens developing teeth. many nutritionists now recommend that children are only allowed one small glass of fruit juice per week as a treat. the new guidelines will specify portions from particular food groups as opposed to dictating precise menus. children must be offered three different types of fruit a week and only two portions of food cooked in oil such as chips, battered fish or chicken nuggets. wholegrain carbohydrates such as brown rice are approved, while refined foods such as white bread are out. the new rules are intended to make meals more creative than under the current system which calls for them to contain specific levels of nutrients such as zinc, vitamin a and folic acid. the food standards to be unveiled by education secretary michael gove aim to clamp down on sugary and fried products offered to children . newly created academies and free schools will also have to follow the food guidelines. until now, academies free from council control and set up post 2010 had been free to make their own rules. this caused controversy last year when research showed nine out of ten academies were selling pupils chocolates and crisps which are banned in other state schools. existing academies will be encouraged to follow the new guidelines. the department for education said the new standards would be easier to enforce and allow schools to be more creative in what they serve and make food preparation a joyful experience. henry dimbleby said this is about encouraging healthier habits and we are trying to encourage milk and water as drinks of choice. fruit juice is as sugary in many cases as canned soft drinks. mr gove will say today these new food standards will ensure all children are able to eat healthy, nutritious meals at school. we now have a clear and concise set of food standards which are easier for cooks to follow and less expensive to enforce. crucially we have achieved this without any compromise on quality or nutrition. tam fry of the national obesity forum welcomed the crackdown on sugary juices, but said he would have gone further in restricting it to one small glass per week. mr fry said fruit juice is known to be really laden with sugar, and it needs to be a treat not an everyday occurrence. the preference in schools should be water which is hugely beneficial.   \n",

awarded the silver star next week, 50 years after he was released from prison and returned to the united states. the award for valor is being bestowed on francis gary powers for exhibiting exceptional loyalty during harsh interrogation while in captivity by the soviet union for nearly two years, the air force said. the silver star is the third highest combat military decoration awarded to members of any u.s. military branch for valor in the face of the enemy, the air force said. the award will be presented to his family friday during a ceremony at the pentagon, officials said. 7 special forces soldiers receive silver star for afghan valor . powers was shot down on may 1, 1960, during a reconnaissance mission over the soviet union, and spent 21 months in a moscow prison. he languished through 61 days of interrogation by the kgb, a trial and conviction for espionage and started serving a 10 year sentence. the incident was one of the most dramatic and tense moments of the cold war, and is credited in large part with the collapse of arms control talks between the u.s. and the soviet union at the paris summit. toast to silver star awarded fallen sailor goes viral . after the united states denied the downed plane was used for spying, the soviets produced large pieces of the plane and put powers on television. during the summit, soviet leader nikita khrushchev launched into a tirade against president dwight d. eisenhower for refusing to apologize, and eisenhower canceled the talks. powers finally returned to the united states in 1962 after a spy exchange with the soviet union. he wrote about his rocky return to the u.s. in his 1970 book, operation overflight a memoir of the u 2 incident. upon his return, powers was criticized for not destroying his plane and the intelligence cache, and for not taking a suicide pill before the soviets captured him. he was debriefed by the cia and testified before the senate armed services select committee. it was determined that he followed orders and did not give away critical information to the soviet union. powers worked at lockheed martin for seven years and later served as a helicopter pilot broadcasting traffic updates in los angeles. he died in a 1977 helicopter crash.   \n",

. a teenage muslim convert accused of planning to behead a british soldier told police he would harm prime minister david cameron if he had the chance, a court heard. brustholm ziamani, 19, was arrested in east london last august carrying a 12 inch knife and a pick hammer wrapped in an islamic flag after boasting how he was going to kill soldiers. he was previously questioned by counter terror police over extremist posts he made online after an earlier arrest last june, his trial at the old bailey heard today. in an exchange from one interview read to the jury, he said he would do harm to the prime minister if he had the opportunity. he was asked by officers to confirm what he had said in a previous interview, in which the tape recorder had broken. the officer said what would you do if you saw david cameron and had an opportunity you said you would do him harm if he had no security around ziamani replied yes. he also put posts on facebook under the name mujahid karim supporting sharia law and stating he was willing to die in the cause of allah, the jury heard. a letter written by ziamani to his parents in which he talked about being martyred and also the murder of fusilier lee rigby in woolwich in may 2013 was also discussed in the interviews. he told police he didnt disagree with the brutal murder of lee rigby and felt it was justified because he had taken part in killing innocent muslims in afghanistan. dc david atkinson of the counter terrorist command, who stopped ziamani on the street, told the court he was wanted by police because he had been posting messages on facebook that encouraged terrorism. dc atkinson said when he stopped the 19 year old, he found a large knife and a hammer in his possession. when the knife and hammer were discovered, ziamani allegedly told officers you havent asked me what they are for. he was interviewed at walworth police station in the presence of his solicitor and said he was upset about the system and the way nothing was being done. ziamani said he was angry muslims were being so laid back and not doing anything about it. in court the jury heard he also put posts on facebook under the name mujahid karim supporting sharia law and stating he was willing to die in the cause of allah. above, a court sketch of ziamani made yesterday . ziamani boasted he was part of the islamic state of ireland and britain in a chilling five page letter to his parents. in the letter for his christian family he had turned his back on, he boasted that he planned to do a 911 and 77 and woolwich all in one day. he warned you want war you got it. british soldiers heads will be removed and burned, u cannot defeat the muslims. we love to die the way you love to live. ziamani told hmp wandsworth security officer paul morris he was on his way to behead a british soldier when he was arrested. he also boasted of knowing one of lee rigbys murderers, michael adebolajo, and muslim hate cleric anjem choudary. he said that he had been arrested and he was on his way to an army barracks, he didnt say where, and said he was going to behead a british soldier and hold his head in the air while a friend unknown was going to photograph him doing so, mr morris told the jury. he was very, very calm. very matter of fact. mr morris had gone to ziamanis single occupancy cell alone for a welfare visit and to see how radical or extreme he may be, the court heard. the guard offered him a chance to see one of two imams at the prison, the jury heard. he said he had already met an imam, had a disagreement with him and said his ideology would not be changed by anyone, mr morris said. we were just having a general chat. he was very polite, very respectful to be fair. he told me he was arrested by police with weapons in his rucksack i believe, the officer continued. he said he knew michael adebolajo, mr morris said, adding he said he loved him and also said he used to hand out islamic leaflets in greenwich with him as well. copycat ziamanis ambition was to allegedly carry out an attack like one one in woolwich by extremists michael adebolajo and michael adebowale, left and right, who killed lee rigby, the court heard yesterday . asked if he was worried, mr morris replied i was very concerned. he just seemed so calm, so direct in the way he described. he said theres nothing i can do to help him. theres nothing we can do to change his ideology. ziamani also asked about belmarsh prison where his real brothers were and said he knew members of islamic group al muhajiroun, known as alm and mentioned anjem choudary, the court heard. the prison guard said he offered ziamani help in the form of a mentor. mr ziamani was not interested. he said my ideology will not be changed by anybody, he added. the court has previously heard he researched the location of army cadet bases in the south east of the capital. ziamani denies planning a terrorist attack. the trial continues. sorry we are

              "94144   on trial brustholm ziamani, 19, was arrested while carrying a 12 inch knife and a hammer and said he would harm david cameron if he had the chance, the old bailey heard today . a teenage muslim convert accused of planning to behead a british soldier told police he would harm prime minister david cameron if he had the chance, a court heard. brustholm ziamani, 19, was arrested in east london last august carrying a 12 inch knife and a pick hammer wrapped in an islamic flag after boasting how he was going to kill soldiers. he was previously questioned by counter terror police over extremist posts he made online after an earlier arrest last june, his trial at the old bailey heard today. in an exchange from one interview read to the jury, he said he would do harm to the prime minister if he had the opportunity. he was asked by officers to confirm what he had said in a previous interview, in which the tape recorder had broken. the officer said what would you do if you saw david cameron and had an opportunity you said you would do him harm if he had no security around ziamani replied yes. he also put posts on facebook under the name mujahid karim supporting sharia law and stating he was willing to die in the cause of allah, the jury heard. a letter written by ziamani to his parents in which he talked about being martyred and also the murder of fusilier lee rigby in woolwich in may 2013 was also discussed in the interviews. he told police he didnt disagree with the brutal murder of lee rigby and felt it was justified because he had taken part in killing innocent muslims in afghanistan. dc david atkinson of the counter terrorist command, who stopped ziamani on the street, told the court he was wanted by police because he had been posting messages on facebook that encouraged terrorism. dc atkinson said when he stopped the 19 year old, he found a large knife and a hammer in his possession. when the knife and hammer were discovered, ziamani allegedly told officers you havent asked me what they are for. he was interviewed at walworth police station in the presence of his solicitor and said he was upset about the system and the way nothing was being done. ziamani said he was angry muslims were being so laid back and not doing anything about it. in court the jury heard he also put posts on facebook under the name mujahid karim supporting sharia law and stating he was willing to die in the cause of allah. above, a court sketch of ziamani made yesterday . ziamani boasted he was part of the islamic state of ireland and britain in a chilling five page letter to his parents. in the letter for his christian family he had turned his back on, he boasted that he planned to do a 911 and 77 and woolwich all in one day. he warned you want war you got it. british soldiers heads will be removed and burned, u cannot defeat the muslims. we love to die the way you love to live. ziamani told hmp wandsworth security officer paul morris he was on his way to behead a british soldier when he was arrested. he also boasted of knowing one of lee rigbys murderers, michael adebolajo, and muslim hate cleric anjem choudary. he said that he had been arrested and he was on his way to an army barracks, he didnt say where, and said he was going to behead a british soldier and hold his head in the air while a friend unknown was going to photograph him doing so, mr morris told the jury. he was very, very calm. very matter of fact. mr morris had gone to ziamanis single occupancy cell alone for a welfare visit and to see how radical or extreme he may be, the court heard. the guard offered him a chance to see one of two imams at the prison, the jury heard. he said he had already met an imam, had a disagreement with him and said his ideology would not be changed by anyone, mr morris said. we were just having a general chat. he was very polite, very respectful to be fair. he told me he was arrested by police with weapons in his rucksack i believe, the officer continued. he said he knew michael adebolajo, mr morris said, adding he said he loved him and also said he used to hand out islamic leaflets in greenwich with him as well. copycat ziamanis ambition was to allegedly carry out an attack like one one in woolwich by extremists michael adebolajo and michael adebowale, left and right, who killed lee rigby, the court heard yesterday . asked if he was worried, mr morris replied i was very concerned. he just seemed so calm, so direct in the way he described. he said theres nothing i can do to help him. theres nothing we can do to change his ideology. ziamani also asked about belmarsh prison where his real brothers were and said he knew members of islamic group al muhajiroun, known as alm and mentioned anjem choudary, the court heard. the prison guard said he offered ziamani help in the form of a mentor. mr ziamani was not interested. he said my ideology will not be changed by anybody, he added. the court has previously heard he researched the location of army cadet bases in the south east of the capital. ziamani denies planning a terrorist attack. the trial continues. sorry we are not currently
